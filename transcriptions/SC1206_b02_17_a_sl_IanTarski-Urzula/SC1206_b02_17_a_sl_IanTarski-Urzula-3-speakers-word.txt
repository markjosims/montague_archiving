SPEAKER_01: 0:00:02-0:00:18
This is just a check to see I left something pushed in and ran my good batteries down. That's a pain in the neck. Shame on you wasting at least a dollar. Can't afford to do that. Do you know anything about that story?

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:20-0:00:34
Not any more than what I actually read saying about article that my father sort of let his wife I think animalistically anticipated biblical sound.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:34-0:00:37
Yeah, yeah, but you don't know any I'm going to put this over here. No,

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:37-0:00:38
no I don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:39-0:00:39
maybe

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:39-0:00:44
would be better to Oh, oh, yes, it's that's going

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:45-0:00:47
to So you don't know any more details.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:48-0:00:49
That's what I read.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:49-0:00:50
Let's see.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:50-0:00:51
News

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:52-0:01:31
Things had already gone bad between Mukushewic and Lashnevsky and Tarsky is in Poland in like in the late thirties that there was some encounter that Peter Hoffman described where they actually asked Taarky to come see him about something at a cafe, but then they would not they wouldn't they went to meet him in the hall and they didn't invite him to the table so they weren't even sitting together they wouldn't sit with him at the same table and there was a lot of bitterness about that they were because they had been, of course, so such close colleagues and even friends I suppose and so this was Wukash

SPEAKER_02: 0:01:32-0:01:35
And Shivski on one hand against my father on the other.

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:37-0:01:52
Sort of both pro and concern because they were for him in terms of the work but then in the anti Semitic climate that existed in Poland approaching the nineteen thirty nine there

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:53-0:01:53
was

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:54-0:02:12
a refusal to be seen with type of atmosphere and you don't know any more about that than I'm telling you. Okay Hoffman is the source for these stories and Hoffman says I mean there's no reason not to believe them. I don't think Hoffman would make up stories like that, do you?

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:13-0:02:13
No

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:14-0:02:15
I believe

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:16-0:02:16
he should be

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:17-0:02:36
reliable reliable and that Tunsky felt a real bitterness, a real sense of betrayal particularly by Upashevits because he had been Upashavits had a wife who was not exactly somebody that everybody welcomed into their home and so

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:36-0:02:36
forth

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:36-0:02:51
and Tarski but Tarski didn't Tarski did. I mean they remained he was friendly towards her and so this turning against him was particularly bitter but you don't know any stories like that

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:53-0:02:53
Well

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:54-0:02:57
yeah let's see if there's any other

default: 0:02:57-0:02:57
Do

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:58-0:03:00
you know who was called Maria Koposhinska

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:02-0:03:04
Luto Mannel's hall and married name?

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:05-0:03:05
Yeah

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:06-0:03:11
and well she was a logician and interested in truth

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:11-0:03:22
because I have quite a few letters in one of the boxes from her in Polish and it's a name I don't know. So she was a logician.

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:23-0:03:47
Yes and I think particularly interested in prude and active in Louf as far as I know. I'm sure that Forenski described this wrote something about her in his book on the Louf Warsaw school Yes and let's see it's possible that she was in the Broadswaff afterwards for a long years I

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:47-0:03:47
see

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:48-0:03:50
in which case should certainly

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:50-0:04:04
notice I don't think there are folders in there when I see that there are letters in Polish, of course I'm not reading them or I can use them and there's a good many letters not a good not there quite

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:04-0:04:04
a few

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:04-0:04:11
letters from Russia and then there's a folder of letters from Kholakovsky again in Polish

SPEAKER_02: 0:04:15-0:04:37
My father expressly thanked Kokoshinska in the article of nineteen forty four the well known one on Sematic Conception of Truth. There are a lot of various details material that was gathered from all kinds of remarks and he thanked her for helping put this together.

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:38-0:04:44
Okay so those are probably the professional letters of some sort.

SPEAKER_02: 0:04:44-0:04:54
Yes I did in the Bancroft Library there's a folder with the letters from her What years did you notice?

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:54-0:04:58
I actually didn't look at the dates but it has

SPEAKER_02: 0:04:59-0:05:04
that would be very interesting I mean probably they were from postwar years

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:04-0:05:08
I would guess that one of the later boxes

SPEAKER_02: 0:05:09-0:05:19
Possibly something from the time of the war but one moment let me I think I can interrupt Ulshula for a moment

default: 0:05:37-0:05:37
Well

SPEAKER_02: 0:05:39-0:05:40
she does remember her

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:41-0:05:43
from Okay so maybe we'll ask her

SPEAKER_02: 0:05:45-0:05:47
I don't know that she would be true.

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:47-0:06:04
Oh yeah Now either Peter Hoffman or Michelsky said that Arin Foy's family was related to the Vitkevic family?

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:04-0:06:05
Vitkatsu

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:05-0:06:05
Yeah

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:08-0:06:09
I heard something like

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:09-0:06:10
this that

default: 0:06:10-0:06:10
they were

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:13-0:06:24
I'm afraid it's something I never learned. It should not be very difficult to find out my sides my sister might possibly know herself being closer to the

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:24-0:06:33
parent voids Do you know whether she saw Anna when she went Anna Tarsco when she went to Poland this time?

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:34-0:06:34
I believe she did

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:35-0:06:35
yes

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:39-0:06:48
Apparently there's a folder of letters from Kokoshinska to my father in the bank of library

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:49-0:06:49
Here

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:50-0:06:51
In Bell Clay

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:51-0:06:52
In Bellclay

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:52-0:06:54
Yes And

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:55-0:07:00
But I didn't look at the dates of them so when was what is her age about

SPEAKER_02: 0:07:00-0:07:01
or is she

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:02-0:07:02

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:00-0:11:29
yes sorry but me the truth now he plays to only the tantaki donkey to some donkey donkey nicha Tasna Damov Professorkirovani Professor

SPEAKER_02: 0:11:32-0:11:56
She lived in a district that was so to say taken off taken over by the city as the city as a whole was taken from Germans and there was no the owners were essentially gone and the houses were distributed to a large extent to the former faculty of

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:56-0:11:57
the

SPEAKER_02: 0:11:58-0:12:05
and a number of scientists from the lived there scientific community. Well academic more generally yes

default: 0:12:06-0:12:06
but

SPEAKER_02: 0:12:06-0:12:07
scientists you mentioned

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:07-0:12:16
Now what was the relationship between Oshpensky and Prokoshinskoki

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:16-0:12:34
and I don't know I know that Professor Posska Lutmann has been on the conference in concern

SPEAKER_02: 0:12:46-0:12:50
She was really a pupil of Aidu Kellichoshinsky Koposhinska

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:50-0:12:51
and you

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:51-0:12:51
were a professor

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:52-0:12:53
now who was your professor?

SPEAKER_02: 0:12:54-0:12:56
Two professors Supenski

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:56-0:13:02
It Slupetsky So Supetski So Supetsky And what were Supetski and Tarsky's relationship?

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:04-0:13:14
Tarski and Supetskifolkovan Sorry Polish nearly the sounds too

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:14-0:13:15
They had the same teachers

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:16-0:13:18
So they had Lezhnevsky

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:19-0:13:19
and

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:19-0:13:24
Kacheki and also Kotarbinsky as well but no

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:25-0:13:30
She does not regard Kotarbinsky as the logician so as a teacher of the logic of

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:30-0:13:30
the

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:30-0:13:31
young logicians

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:31-0:13:31
No

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:32-0:13:33
but my father evidently does regard

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:34-0:13:46
your father regarded Kotarbinsky extremely highly. I think he was a moral a moral influence spiritual and I think he always liked to mention him first

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:47-0:13:49
above Lesnievsky even

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:49-0:13:54
the two of them yes and I think you might explain that to her and

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:54-0:14:04
she sort of likes to make the point that Slupetsky felt it was that my father's outlook in this respect was insulting to Mukachievich.

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:05-0:14:07
Yes so I think it was deliberately so

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:07-0:14:23
I see and I did not know it's hard to say what was the relative influence but Shula likes to relate the opinion of Supski that Obasevich deserves a lot more credit than my father has been given me.

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:23-0:14:26
Well because does she understand how angry your father became? Yes

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:26-0:14:30
that it was on account of matters of anti Semitism

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:31-0:14:31
Right

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:32-0:14:33
I think there's more to it than that

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:34-0:14:36
and there yes I think if you look at the first

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:37-0:14:46
papers of my father's then there is there are many references or occasions to mention Lesnyvsky and not at all

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:47-0:14:48
Fukasivi

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:48-0:14:50
Oh no I think there is only one mention of Fukasivi

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:50-0:15:04
somewhere in the first several papers so I think I think there was a personal and a professional separation is my Yes And that the professional came first and the personal afterward.

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:06-0:15:24
Les Dives Kating had a lot more of ideas that my father sort of could weigh and appreciate and perhaps use them as the basis for his further speculations and Lesnevsky's work in logic no sorry Sievich's work in logic amounted to sentential calculus which

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:24-0:15:25
is

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:25-0:15:26
really baby stuff

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:27-0:15:27
Sorry

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:31-0:16:33
it is it was primarily sentential calculus and also history of logic which was something that was quite from which my father was quite removed I mean that's perhaps the primary upcoming credit of Fukasivich the discovery of the stoic school Yesoda said Supesky regards himself as pupil of whom first Ukasevic?

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:33-0:16:34
Hukasevic in the first place

SPEAKER_02: 0:16:36-0:16:48
in the second place and my father in the third place And she said that Kotarvinsky was primarily in Woods, the Polish city of Woods and so he really was just a little bit to the side of the

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:49-0:16:54
Right with the same issues either he didn't deal with the same subject matter. He did not deal

SPEAKER_02: 0:16:54-0:16:57
with the same subject and there was also the geographical subject

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:59-0:17:07
So did I'm having trouble pronouncing it Swepetski Swopetski did he actually take courses from Tarski?

default: 0:17:07-0:17:07
Did

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:07-0:17:07
he go to

SPEAKER_02: 0:17:09-0:18:12
school as an appearance the seminars were under the direction of Ukasevic and Wesnevsky but my father had many talks gave many talks in

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:13-0:18:14
the seminars and

SPEAKER_02: 0:18:14-0:18:41
in this sense Swepetsky learned from my father and my father obtained his doctorate in nineteen twenty four and Swepetski because of health problems only in nineteen thirty five so for many years my father already had many of his own discoveries to talk about to present and Mesdievsky was only finishing Swupeski was only finishing the doctor.

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:42-0:18:49

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:12-0:25:15
I'm sure that Solomon is aware of that. Yeah.

That's very nice. How old is she?

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:23-0:25:29
She's yeah she's seven months now. That was I think she was about

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:29-0:25:29
six

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:29-0:25:30
months.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:38-0:25:42
Oh I showed this up I saw that's a wonderful picture

SPEAKER_02: 0:25:48-0:25:50
is this is a garden

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:51-0:25:53
I thought maybe that was a bodyguard. Yeah

SPEAKER_02: 0:25:53-0:25:53
the tenth.

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:54-0:25:56
Yesterday. Yes

SPEAKER_02: 0:25:56-0:25:57
you guessed right

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:58-0:25:58
the bodyguard

SPEAKER_02: 0:25:58-0:25:59
of the bodyguard.

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:00-0:26:04
Didn't he just have that look of a bodyguard? That's how they all look the same

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:06-0:26:07
This one also?

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:09-0:26:13
No, on the other side. Yes,

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:13-0:26:13
yes.

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:13-0:26:13
Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:13-0:26:14
Right.

default: 0:26:16-0:26:16
Right.

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:17-0:26:27
Let's see, what else did I want? So do you have a sense of how close as friends Vitievic and Tarsky were? Do you know?

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:27-0:26:35
Hard to say but I had occasion to look at some of the philosophical texts of Witkatsky.

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:35-0:26:36
Yeah. And

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:37-0:26:38
he was not particularly kind to my father.

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:39-0:26:40
He was not kind to

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:40-0:26:41
but

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:41-0:26:54
that doesn't mean they wouldn't have though he wasn't kind to anybody. I mean I meant whether there was a genuine friendship there as a not a professional friendship but a personal friendship. You

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:54-0:27:00
don't know I think it was there was some kind of a friendship something in that direction.

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:01-0:27:01
How

SPEAKER_02: 0:27:01-0:27:02
close I just couldn't tell

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:02-0:27:03
you. Yeah. Right.

SPEAKER_02: 0:27:03-0:27:17
But I think they certainly knew each other and I'm sure that they had occasions to meet over coffee coffee and such and not only in the painter and client.

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:17-0:27:36
Well you know Vitievich lived in Zakopane, which is near in the tata I guess at the base of the Tatar Mountains and of course the Tars your parents went all the time to go hiking but I don't know whether they actually went and stayed with Vitked. Did they stay in Zakopane? Would they have done that, do you think?

SPEAKER_02: 0:27:38-0:27:43
I think that they would be more likely to go up to the mountains rather than stay in Zakopane.

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:43-0:27:50
No, but I mean isn't Zakopane a place where you might start and then go climbing afterwards use that as your base camp as it were?

SPEAKER_02: 0:27:50-0:28:02
Yes but whether they would be staying with Vidkvich with Vidkatsi, I rather doubt it you know Zakopani is one place where you have tourists coming all the time and

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:03-0:28:03
who are here

SPEAKER_02: 0:28:04-0:28:13
would sort of tend to be tend to withdraw from and not be eager to receive so many guests because otherwise they would have to put up with the guests permanently.

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:13-0:28:17
Well, but they sort there was sort of a salon there as I understand it. I

SPEAKER_02: 0:28:17-0:28:18
have no idea no idea I

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:18-0:28:29
can one of the people who wrote the most about Vitkevich is somebody named Gerld, Daniel Gerld, who's the editor of many of the books of plays and so

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:29-0:28:29
forth

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:29-0:28:40
and he was in Berkeley and he acknowledges both your mother and father as sources for stories about Vidkevich.

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:40-0:28:40
So

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:40-0:28:51
that's what made me think that there must have been something more than just sitting for a portrait definitely more than

SPEAKER_02: 0:28:51-0:28:57
my father that my father said it wasn't just that he saw the name announced

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:58-0:28:58
or

SPEAKER_02: 0:28:58-0:29:02
advertised somewhere and went to him and paid them to pick up the picked up the portrait

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:04-0:29:07
but he also went to seminars at the you know he went to

SPEAKER_02: 0:29:09-0:29:10
Philosophy Carlan

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:10-0:29:11
point of view and he

SPEAKER_02: 0:29:11-0:29:12
wrote about philosophy

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:12-0:29:17
total madman absolute madman Have you seen any of his plays?

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:19-0:29:19
This plays

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:20-0:29:22
Dykevich's plays, have you seen any performed?

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:24-0:29:34
I don't know I'm thinking that Dykvich lived in different places.

default: 0:29:34-0:29:35
Oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:35-0:29:57
yeah, he lived he lived in Zakopane, he came to Warsaw but his plays were performed all around so and apparently there's been a renaissance of his work and so that people in theater are doing his plays I mean they were twenty five years ahead of their time people say so I thought maybe you might have seen I

SPEAKER_02: 0:29:57-0:30:00
don't remember do you take sugar? No it's just fine.

SPEAKER_01: 0:30:00-0:30:11
Thank you. Milk? No perfect unless it's so stronger. It's good, young. Good coffee.

default: 0:30:15-0:30:15
So

SPEAKER_01: 0:30:16-0:31:28
that's something that well I'll ask around. I've actually written to this man but he hasn't answered but there are I don't know four or five or six books now in English about Dick Kavid. And also there's a book there's a book of interviews between Alexander Wat and Milos Milos and those are interesting reflections on life at home because Wat was an exact contemporary of Tarski and also was a Jew who became assimilated and who converted to took on the I think and also was for a time communist and then anti and so some of the patterns of his life are similar to the patterns of Tarski's life just in the social the social aspects, the social political aspects of his life. So I've been reading those conversations.

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:30-0:31:59
I know that my teacher is Professor Lili Supreki very appreciate the activity Taski and he said us that Taski was the special danish and he needn't the teachers.

default: 0:32:00-0:32:00
He

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:00-0:32:06
didn't what? He didn't teach us. He didn't need him He

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:06-0:32:07
did not need teachers. That's what she

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:07-0:32:08
what

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:08-0:32:09
Fupet Kid said to

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:09-0:32:12
say about my father teach himself and

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:31-0:32:41
that's to say the same thing. Slupeski would appear that my father went to the seminars and took advantage of the atmosphere and the

SPEAKER_01: 0:32:41-0:32:42
various

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:42-0:32:44
remarks but basically he did not need a teacher.

SPEAKER_01: 0:32:44-0:33:01
He didn't need a teacher. Well sure by that time he was yeah Did he say anything about his talents of exposition? How he what kind of a teacher Tarski himself was? How did he describe Tarsky's lectures to you? What did he say

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:01-0:33:02
about Tarsky's

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:02-0:33:02
man?

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:02-0:33:25
Yeski

SPEAKER_02: 0:33:28-0:33:29
Expositi

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:30-0:33:31
Expositi

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:37-0:33:45
nothing specific Well I just wondered if he held if Supetski held him up as he up as a model or not and

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:57-0:33:58
they were

SPEAKER_02: 0:33:58-0:34:03
extremely clear that remembers

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:18-0:34:37
Other mathematician view now

SPEAKER_02: 0:34:41-0:35:22
Students in Brosove they all heard about my father and Supeski used to say that they can use these worlds as models where every detail has been thought through yes He used to say Warsaw school rather than Lou Warsaw

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:22-0:35:22
he

SPEAKER_02: 0:35:22-0:35:24
never used the name of Lu.

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:24-0:35:24
So

SPEAKER_02: 0:35:26-0:35:29
during the time when you were a student in

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:29-0:35:30
Wrocswaux

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:51-0:35:51
emphasize

SPEAKER_02: 0:36:16-0:36:41
Shula says that Strupzki emphasized the formal and side of the teachings of the Warsaw school and that the formal aspects were emphasized all the time and she says that she finds out how to incorporate Kotarbinski into

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:42-0:36:42
that

SPEAKER_02: 0:36:45-0:37:06
outlook or this point of view because of his opposite or yes well

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:08-0:37:08
look

SPEAKER_02: 0:37:08-0:37:14
you were just talking and talking and talking and talking and then you know by the time you

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:14-0:37:14
finished I

SPEAKER_02: 0:37:14-0:37:16
forgot what you said in the

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:16-0:37:16
beginning

SPEAKER_02: 0:37:18-0:38:10
All right Swopski has emphasized the importance of this of the Warsaw school yes because of the ability or the emphasis on the formal and precise solutions and assuming certain philosophical outlook

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:16-0:38:16
and

SPEAKER_02: 0:38:18-0:38:28
precise formal solutions I think this is my father had quite a bit more in him that went beyond the formal

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:29-0:38:59
Absolutely. I mean everybody brings in this business of him speaking of himself as a nominalist and his believing in being kind of a Platonist somehow deep down and then there are various quotes that people will say of what he himself said. He says that he realizes it's all fairy tales but it's good to believe in fairy tales so there is a you know there's a duality

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:59-0:38:59
in people

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:00-0:39:24
I think I think that's important to remember, especially when you're each piece of work is discrete, you know, but when you're talking about a scope of a life people are conflicted they don't always there are always these two things that pull at you and so I think it's not

default: 0:39:25-0:39:25
you

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:25-0:39:55
know each piece of work is a piece of work in itself but what happens over a lifetime and what people's temptations are and how they may resist these temptations. So Tarski himself spoke of these temptations and it really is interesting that he thinks always thought of Kocarvinsky as his mentor and I think it was a good deal a spiritual mentor more than you see what I mean? But I don't devalue it because of that when I'm speaking of a life.

default: 0:39:56-0:39:56
In

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:56-0:40:07
other words, if you're speaking of each discrete piece of work, you might look at it differently but if you're speaking of a life that includes more than work or yeah that

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:08-0:40:16
the formal side is something my father could have learned by himself or by himself and the philosophical vision is something that he could not.

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:17-0:40:19
Well you could, you could come to that Well

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:19-0:40:23
I mean but in his case this he got from Kotarbit

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:24-0:40:26
it was an early inspiration let's

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:26-0:40:46
say the problem

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:50-0:40:56
Lesnievsky and Bukasevich were both philosophy students under Twaldovsky

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:57-0:40:57
It

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:57-0:41:04
was really kind of a surprise something really incredible almost that they became

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:04-0:42:02
professors of mathematics You know I have this funny what's the word conjecture about Tarski choosing the name Tarski. The story is according to Dana Scott that he chose the name because the person if you took another name and it belonged to somebody else that person had a right to refuse that you take that name and so he and his brother who were both looked through all the registry of names for Warsaw and they only found one old woman with this name Tarski, so they figured she wasn't likely to complain, so that was a safe name to take. But my further conjecture is that it's a contraction of Twordovsky so that it was a very pleasing name for him

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:02-0:42:04
to take I don't know if he take no

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:04-0:42:15
proof no proof of course but it just struck me one day that Tarsky and Tardovski you take out a few letters and you've got that. So why not? And he's the kind of man who would have thought of that. If I thought of it so would he

SPEAKER_02: 0:42:17-0:42:24
my mother related something like this perhaps not as full a story or

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:25-0:42:25
a

SPEAKER_02: 0:42:25-0:42:28
slightly different version that was taped by Constance Reed?

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:28-0:42:38
Yeah. Well tell me what you 'cause when I asked Constance Reed about this tape she doesn't remember, she doesn't know where it is tell me the story I

SPEAKER_02: 0:42:38-0:42:38
don't know where the tape

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:38-0:42:38
is

SPEAKER_02: 0:42:39-0:42:40
but I remember this being taped.

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:40-0:42:44
Okay, so tell me what she told her on the tape because I may not hear it from Constance.

SPEAKER_02: 0:42:46-0:43:17
She essentially said the same thing except that my father she didn't that is my mother did not recall this question of somebody being able to protest but my father just did not want to have a name that would be very common so when he came up on this name and found that just that there was one old woman or something approximately that then he was ready to adopt it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:17-0:43:20
Yeah it is a very unusual name certainly

SPEAKER_02: 0:43:23-0:43:31
we remember there being listed in the phone book here in the Bay Area some tars here we had some phone calls asking for the famous pilot

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:32-0:43:32
Pilot?

SPEAKER_02: 0:43:33-0:43:33
Yes

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:33-0:43:54
Oh really? Pilot airplane So well that's interesting Okay any more stories about Tarski that you know that people have told you

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:55-0:43:55
from

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:58-0:44:06
Okay, what sort of stories do you hear? Any kind? Gossip, mathematical, social

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:07-0:44:12
No mathematical and weak logic

SPEAKER_02: 0:44:19-0:44:38
historians She says she can perhaps recreate some stories or details by talking with

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:40-0:45:16
them I would really appreciate that if you would ask him any kind of stories, gossip, romances You know what I like very much in a book are anecdotes, not generalizations. You know, what brings a book to life is the detail. So you know a specific thing that happened in a seminar, a specific conversation, specificity is what counts. Those generalizations are not any fun to read.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:38-0:45:38
One moment

SPEAKER_02: 0:45:38-0:45:54
let me translate that one difficulty with this is that Skupeski did not like to chat or to relate anecdotes. He sort of tried to restrict himself to just strict business like scientific matters.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:55-0:46:22
Yeah, but even in scientific matters sometimes there is an anecdote you see what I mean that is an illustration of an exchange. You know what I mean It's always the small detail, the conversation that illuminates the whole and no matter what kind of thing you're writing you need that and so it doesn't have to be gossip

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:22-0:46:22
but

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:23-0:46:27
it has to deal with a small thing that illuminates the large.

default: 0:46:29-0:46:29
So

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:29-0:46:31
if there's something that he can remember about that

SPEAKER_02: 0:46:33-0:46:35
she would be she, Spuketski's widow Oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:35-0:46:36
yes oh I see yes or she

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:37-0:46:37
would

SPEAKER_02: 0:46:46-0:46:53
Supeski wrote an article in Polish about the Lufosa school

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:54-0:46:55
Not Warsaw school

SPEAKER_02: 0:46:57-0:46:57
Yes and

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:57-0:46:58
she

SPEAKER_02: 0:46:58-0:46:59
studied this at home

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:00-0:47:34
Polish. Well there are any if in that article if you look through it and you see anything that is a detail and you can tell me what the circumstances are around the detail. But I just read something by somebody that I know actually which was about Lydia Ginsburg, a writer a writer and a critic in Russia. This is a Slavist who wrote this thing and it is really an extremely intellectual article about a very specific take on literary criticism, let's say.
