SPEAKER_01: 0:00:00-0:00:18
 Sure, sure, Ed.  So one thing that I reminded, if you  don't mind repeating those two moments of interaction  that you had with Richard.  In particular, I was thinking, you told me,  let's see if I remember correctly,  one was the story of your parents were managing a store.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:18-0:00:54
 Oh, yeah.  Remember correctly?  Yeah, this was during the war.  Yeah, during, yes.  About 1944, I guess it was.  Yeah, my parents owned a little grocery store.  Was it in Stockton?  In Stockton on North Wilson Way. You know, a little mom and pop store about the size of a 7-11.  The store is still there, but now it's a liquor store I believe.  Oh, is it still there? Do you remember the address? I'm curious. Since I'll be in Stockton, maybe I can drive there. Yeah, it's just a couple... it's actually two blocks north of Harding Way on Wilson Way.  Okay, so...  It's on Wilson Way, two blocks north of Harding on the right side.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:54-0:00:58
 Wilson Way, two blocks north of...

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:58-0:01:48
 Yeah, and you'll see it's the only liquor store there.  And it's on the right, so it should be real easy to find.  Okay, thank you.  No, so I was saying, during the war, you know,  after school I used to go over there and work in the store.  I used to stock shells and wait on customers.  So I was telling Rich about it one day,  and he said, well, man, do you mind if I come over with you someday after school?  I said, hey, no, that'd be great.  So we took a bus from school and went out to the store hey you know that'd be great so we took a bus from school  and went out the store you know and I was stocking shelves and old Richie was  all he was really excited about it so he helped me stock the shelves you know and  I just showed him how we did everything yeah I waited on customers and Rich was  standing there watching everything oh I think he You know, I don't think he's ever had that kind of experience before.  Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:48-0:01:56
 Being out like that.  Very likely, because he was an only child, overprotected,  and I don't think he would have any kind of like...

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:56-0:02:09
 I don't think he had a social...  After I talked to you, I remembered,  when we were in high school, he never had a girlfriend,  or never went out with  girls and never went to any of the school dances.

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:09-0:02:22
 I want to ask you, did the school organize dances, events?  Because from some of the picture on the yearbooks that I saw, it looked like you guys were going ... Sometimes it looks like you were skiing maybe or you were going to... Okay, so can

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:22-0:02:43
 you tell me the very events?  We would have school dances three or four times a year, and we'd have a senior ditch  day. I think those pictures I sent you were from a senior ditch day, and we also had a  junior senior ditch day. So the ones I sent you, I don't know if they did you any good.

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:43-0:02:46
 Yeah, yeah, I made some copies because they gave me an idea of like...

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:46-0:03:08
 The ones I gave you were... some of them were taken at Pinecrest above Sonora.  Oh, okay.  Which is now is, you know, a ski resort during the winter.  But they had the lake there and during the summer we used to... lot of the high school guys used to go up there.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:08-0:03:10
 You guys drive there? How do you go there?

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:10-0:03:15
 Yeah, we used to drive. We hitchhiked a couple of times. A couple of us hitchhiked or we drove.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:15-0:03:21
 Can I ask you Ed, how old did you have to be at that time to drive? You had to be 18, you had to be 16?

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:21-0:04:28
 Yeah, you had to be 16 to get a driver's license.  License. to be 16? Yeah, you had to be 16 to get a driver's license. Yeah, so that's when I got  mine. I know my brother, older brother, taught me how to drive. My folks had an old 29 Buick.  We used to call it the Bomber in high school. It was huge. Anyway, those pictures were taken  at Pinecrest and some of those pictures were during junior  senior day and they were taken at Marsh Creek.  Had a little swimming pool and a little kind of a resort area and that was near Walnut  Creek.  Just east of Walnut Creek, I don't know, 15, 20 miles, but it was an easy drive  from Stockton. So we had school activities there. But yeah, we used to get together,  but Rich wasn't interested. Couples used to get together and double dig. Go out.  We used to rent motor scooters.

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:28-0:04:32
 To go on the water?  No, motor scooters.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:34-0:04:45
 They were a lot different than they were today.  Really?  They were just little small motor scooters and it only sat two people.  They wouldn't go very fast.  But it was fun riding around town.  And that type of thing. So in that sense, two people, they wouldn't go very fast. But it was fun riding around town, you know, and

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:45-0:04:49
 that type of thing. So in that sense, Richard wouldn't participate

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:49-0:05:08
 with these kind of activities? No, I haven't seen Rich... I don't remember  seeing Rich at any of the ditch days. I know I never saw him at a school dance, or I never  saw him, or even heard of him, going out on a date with girls. I think his mother must have really been sheltering him or, I don't know.

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:08-0:05:54
 Yeah, I mean, like, unfortunately, you know, she died a long time ago and she was the youngest  daughter of a large family, so she was the youngest one, all the others died earlier.  And Richard was an only child and they had him when they were already old.  Like for that time, actually you can tell me, for a couple.  So Richard's parents got married relatively young, but they had him 15 years after they got married.  So the mother was almost 36 and the father was 41.  How common was, I mean these days it's not uncommon for a couple to have a child when  they're married. But at that time, was it kind of uncommon for a couple that had been  married for 15 years to have their first child at that age? Do you have a sense?

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:54-0:07:05
 I don't know. I don't have any idea. I'll tell you the truth. I know there were seven  kids in our family. I think my mother had them when she started at about 18. But I really don't know, I can't  answer that question. Did Rich ever get married?  No, he didn't.  Oh, he never got married?  No, he never got married.  That's funny, he was kind of a loner. Well, he had friends at school, but they were all  like myself and Richard Huddleston, there was a picture of him standing next to Rich, I believe, in the yearbook.  But I think Richard Huddleston, he's dead now, but I think that he was one of Rich's closest friends.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, and I think they used to hang out together during recess.  But I don't know if they ever went out together or did anything after school or anything.  But we saw them quite often, I saw those two, Richard Huddleston and Richard Montague.  And I know in the yearbook, there's a picture of Rich and Rich. It was a group picture, but I believe they were standing next to each other.

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:05-0:07:39
 I'll check, yeah, I have those pictures. Oh, actually, yeah, maybe you can recognize...  I think I remember the name now that you mentioned it, because there were so many names.  I think I made a copy of... I mean, these are like bigger copies  of those pictures, so the quality is very low. These are all pictures with Richard. That's

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:39-0:07:50
 Rich there and then there's Rich Huddleston. I think they were probably better friends than Rich was with anybody else. Boy, these kids, it's actually too bad you couldn't take these on

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:50-0:08:09
 a color printer or something. Well, the thing is that they are all black and white. Yeah,  but I mean the resolution would have been so much sharper. No, no, no. So what happens  is this is actually one of the highest possible resolutions.  It's the original picture that they are like,  because remember, the original picture has this size.

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:09-0:08:11
 Oh, I got you.  So you increased it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:11-0:08:29
 You had to increase it to make it easier.  But what happens is since the picture  was not that high quality,  because it got printed on a book,  had I had the negative, it would have been fantastic.  But probably nobody has the negatives  of those pictures these days. So I just made them bigger. Oh, I thought that might have been fantastic yeah probably nobody has the negative these days so I just made them bigger but oh I thought that might have been

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:29-0:08:33
 Bill McFaul but I don't think it is I know you did you talk to bill I talked

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:33-0:08:47
 to him by email so he now lives in northern and north of here so he  contacted me by email and we had a little bit of a email correspond oh good  so because it is, this is actually,  this is still bigger, but this is closer to the original size.

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:47-0:08:49
 Oh, yeah, that's better.  Yeah, that looks a little better.

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:49-0:09:02
 And then it gets a little bit,  actually, the original is a little bit smaller than this.  Right, right.  Well, good, I'm glad you got all these pictures.  Yeah, so no, the yearbook was very useful.  And for example, something interesting,  you see, this is a picture from the War Bond Committee.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:02-0:09:03
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:03-0:09:09
 1944, 1945.  Yeah, what was, I think, was Rich on that one? Interestingly45. Interestingly, they list all the names, they

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:09-0:09:19
 don't list his name. I saw Rich there and I said, I wonder why his name isn't on there.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:19-0:09:34
 No, that's him, that's Rich alright. I have one more question for you in case, I know  it's hard to, but I found another picture,  you know sometimes the yearbook says these pictures at the end, the last page.  Oh, I didn't see that one.  Do you think this could be him?  Don't you think?  That is him.  I think it's him.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:34-0:09:40
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, no doubt.  Oh, okay, okay.  No doubt, that's him.  I didn't realize that he rode a bike to school.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:40-0:09:42
 Me neither, so that's a picture that was important.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:42-0:09:44
 You know, I didn't see that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:44-0:09:47
 I looked at all those pictures. It's like one of those pictures sometimes

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:47-0:10:10
 in the yearbook. At the end of the book. They had the whole student body. I'm sorry I missed  that. Actually, that's a pretty good picture of him. I like it. So this was either in 46 or 47, because those were the yearbooks here.

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:10-0:10:17
 Those were the only two yearbooks I had.  Ed, I forgot to mention another thing.  I found, when I went to St. Mary's, I found the 43-44.

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:17-0:11:21
 That's where he was.  So it wasn't in the yearbook.  No, this was his first year at St. Mary's.  So I have two pictures from his first year.  That's why I didn't see it. Richard Hallstone is here. He's playing  the piano. That's what I was telling you. That was the other story I was telling you  about during assembly. We used to have assembly for the whole student body once a month. We'd  meet in the assembly room. They had a big assembly  room upstairs. And Rich was the official accompanist. But he'd always play this high classical music  kind of stuff. So one day we'd start razzing him about, hey, don't you know any boogie  woogie or can't you play any swing? And he turned around and looked and man he went back to his piano  and he started to pop out boogie woogie and it was really good. Really? By ear, he played  everything by ear. Wow. He was a great piano player. Yeah, I know Mary and Benny and those  guys will probably tell you the same thing. Yeah, I'm curious to hear from them because

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:21-0:11:26
 you know like later on, well, I'm on blood thinner.

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:26-0:11:42
 You know, I have some heart problems, so I got me on blood thinner.  And I fell yesterday.  And every time I bump my elbow, I break the skin.  That's why I got all these damn bandages on.  And this one I just have trouble stopping.  That's what this is.

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:42-0:11:47
 Oh, yeah, no, no, no.  I realize I just want to check.  Is there anything we can do? No, I'll put on a new bandage yeah yeah I take a break

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:47-0:12:11
 take a break no no why don't you know it's okay for now I sure well you sure  yeah better go let me go clean the table your time  That picture that you had of the bridge playing the piano, which one was that?

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:14-0:12:22
 I think it was right here, let me see. The one that was taken in his first year, that was 1943-44.  Where did I put it?  Not this one, no, here it is.  This one here.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:22-0:12:29
 Yeah, well see, with all the kids standing around there,  I wouldn't be surprised if he was beating out a little swing music or boogie-woogie.

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:29-0:12:31
 Probably, probably.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:31-0:12:37
 Yeah, because that's, you know...  There's Richard Huddleston again.  Yes, yes, that's him.  They were pretty good friends, I think.

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:37-0:12:44
 Anyway...  But I do not... So Richard is not alive anymore?  I don't see his name in the list.  So Richard Huddleston...

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:44-0:12:54
 No, no, I know he's dead.  He's dead. Yeah. I saw that in the school annual or semi-annual magazine a few years ago.

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:56-0:13:00
 Do you know if he stayed in Stockton or if he moved away? I don't really know what happened to

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:00-0:13:07
 him at all. Maybe Mary or Bernice or Benny might know.

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:07-0:13:18
 So can I ask you, going back to when he was playing the piano, so it was common for when  you had the assembly? Yeah, yeah, he was the official, in fact I

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:18-0:13:50
 think in the yearbook it even said he was the official accompanist at the assembly. So he would all, you know, we'd sing songs and  Rich would be on the piano playing them. So that was his job. So I think Sister David  asked him to do it and he did it. So yeah, he usually played piano every time, once a  month when we were, you know, had the assembly. Because I, yeah, we always sang a song or two. Yeah, you know, later on, I mean, like people that

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:51-0:14:35
 got to know him later in college or when he was a professor at UCLA. So what they told me is that  he was a very high level organist. Oh yeah. In fact, I think in his last year in Stockton and  then all his years in Berkeley when he  was a graduate student, he had a double job.  He was working as a graduate student and then he was hired every year from a congregation,  different congregation in the Oakland area to be the official-  Organist?  Yeah, the master of music.  So the organist and the choir director.  Oh, really?  And in fact, I think I have a picture here.  I lost, actually, I don't know if you... it's  a very poor picture. I tried to blow it up, but the quality of the picture to begin with  is very poor. But so it's... here it is. It's a senior... it was from your yearbook, the

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:35-0:14:41
 senior choir. Oh, the senior choir. Oh, this was taken in the cathedral. That's what I

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:41-0:15:24
 thought. Right next door to St. Mary's. Yeah. Do you think it's possible, I know it's very good, look, this is Richard?  This here?  Yeah, the one in the back.  No, that looks like a girl.  You think this one here?  Oh, I swear to God.  Yes, it's totally right because what I saw, I got the transcripts, St. Mary's gave me  Richard's transcripts and I noticed that in his last, actually for the last two years,  he took a class that was called chorale. Chorale. Which I assume that it's like to do with  the choir. And so, and I know that Richard was hired by the Catholic Church after he  graduated in 1947 for one year. He was hired as the organist and the choir director. So

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:24-0:15:29
 it was one. So, you know, it could be, yeah.  If you look at it from the back... It has a small frame...

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:29-0:15:31
 Yeah, it has a small frame that's recharged.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:31-0:15:33
 Yeah, but I couldn't say for sure.

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:33-0:15:35
 Yeah, I know, I know, that's...

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:37-0:15:39
 Yeah, I remember the old choir, the old senior choir.

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:39-0:15:44
 Yeah.  So there was a choir in the school, independently from the church?

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:44-0:16:16
 Yeah, yeah. Ah, okay.  Yeah, they used to have regular choir practices.  During the school year?  During the school, and then, you know, every student at St. Mary's was required to go to  church.  You know, whenever the Catholics went to church, whether you were Catholic or not, you had  to attend the Mass or whatever was happening in the church. At the masses, the choir is the one that used  to sing. I see. So, you know, I don't know if Richard, he may even play, I don't know

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:16-0:16:29
 if he played the organ or... So, I know for sure that from 1947 to 1948, the Church of the Annunciation hired him officially. So he was hired and  he was paid after he graduated.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:29-0:16:40
 Of course, the organ wasn't right here, it was down above. Let me see if I see Mary or  Benny or anybody in here. You could ask them tomorrow.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:40-0:16:47
 Yeah, I'll ask them, definitely, because I think they were in the choir, I think.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:47-0:16:52
 Oh, there's Paul DeCarli. He's the guy that I was telling you was also a professor at Stanford.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:52-0:16:58
 Yes, yes. I tried to contact, actually, I...  Is he still alive?  No, Paul died three years ago.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:58-0:17:00
 That's what I thought, yeah.  2013.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:00-0:17:18
 Yeah.  But his wife and his children are alive, so I tried to contact his wife, but I got the letter back.  But now I think I found his son.  I just wrote him yesterday.  His son lives in San Francisco.  So I explained what it is, and maybe he  may have some material or something we may remember.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:18-0:17:22
 Yeah, I don't see Mary Phelan or Bernice Pratt.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:22-0:17:30
 Unfortunately, the original picture is a small one, and it it's very low quality so I tried to blow it up  but you see the results so it's really, really hard.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:30-0:17:32
 I can't help you out there.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:32-0:18:00
 No, no, but it's been really great.  I have the same question about in general, like from whatever you remember about St.  Mary's and also about St. Mary's and your experience there.  Because what I want to do in this chapter, I would like to describe Richard at St. Mary's and your experience there. So, which could have, because what I want to do in this chapter,  I would like to describe Richard at St. Mary's and therefore also St. Mary's.  What it meant to be a high school student at St. Mary's.  How was the life there?  You know, like how was the atmosphere?  For example, one question that I have for you is that I saw from the yearbooks  that you were heavily involved with sports.

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:00-0:18:01
 Yeah, right.

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:01-0:18:03
 I mean, you were in a variety of teams, you were the leader and so on.

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:03-0:18:11
 In fact, I was inducted into the St. Mary's Athletic Hall of Fame, I think it was 2016,

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:11-0:18:16
 10 years ago. Was it a family tradition in your family

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:16-0:18:26
 to be into sports or you were the sportsy one? Well, my brothers also played sports,  but I was a better athlete than them. You know, they played basketball.

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:26-0:18:29
 I saw some Baccarat name. How do you pronounce your last name?

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:29-0:18:43
 Barakat.  Barakat.  Yeah, my brother Tom played basketball.  I saw Tom, yes.  And my brother Jim played basketball.  Yes, I saw them. They were in the future.  So, but I played. I was serious about it.  And they just kind of played it as a hobby.

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:43-0:18:45
 So you really liked it and you put it...

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:45-0:19:01
 In fact, I put in more time in sports than I did in studying, which... because I'm sorry  about that now because I'm not as smart as a lot of other people. I never went to college  after. I don't think my grades would have let me in anyway. I was not a good student.

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:01-0:19:02
 I hate myself.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:02-0:19:25
 But you loved sports. Yeah, I was a good athlete, but not a good student.  No, but the life, you know, the class, our class had only 55 kids in it.  Oh, so it was a small one.  So yeah, and in the whole school, I bet there couldn't have been more than 300 students.  Okay, good.  You knew almost everybody by name, you know, and almost every class.

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:25-0:19:48
 So Ed, can you give me an idea? So you said your class was roughly 55 students. I grew  up in Italy, so I'm familiar with Italian school system, which probably is different.  So you guys were 55 of you, but how were classes structured? Like for example, when there was the history class or Latin or Maths, all

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:48-0:20:17
 you 55 were divided into units. No, no, no. People took different classes. I think the  classes probably didn't have more than 25 people in each class, but you never took all  the subjects. You could choose your subjects. But you never took all the subjects.  Oh, you could choose your subjects.  When you were a freshman, you were required to take Latin. You had to take Latin.  You had to take Latin.  I flunked out of Latin. I told you I'm not a very good student.  But you had to take Latin.

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:17-0:20:18
 Well, look at what you got.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:18-0:20:59
 Yeah, you had to take Latin and you had to take English and you had to take History.  Some of the other classes, like Typing, you didn't had to take English and you had to take history and some of the other  classes like typing you didn't have to take. You know, Mrs. Ligorio, I think she might  have taught shorthand. Ask Mary and Bernice. The more I got to thinking about it, I'd think,  well, my sisters knew shorthand. The only place they could have learned it was in high  school. So probably Ligorio, the only lay teacher there, probably taught typing  and shorthand. But ask Mary Ann and Bernice tomorrow when you see them.

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:59-0:21:02
 And so there were some required classes and then you guys would take?

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:02-0:21:27
 Yeah, and then you took. I liked algebra and I liked mechanical drawing. You didn't  have to take mechanical drawing. But it was an option.  Yeah, but it was an old class. I got an A on it, so I didn't get kicked out of it. So  no wonder I liked it, right? I think Benny might have taken it too, Benny and Alberti.  But mechanical drawing, believe it, was mostly for boys. I don't think a lot of the girls weren't interested in that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:27-0:21:30
 Who was teaching mechanical drawing? Was it still a nun?

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:30-0:21:45
 No, it was one of the nuns. I forget which nun it was, to tell you the truth. It might  have been Sister Jordan. But it was definitely a nun?  Oh yeah, oh yeah. Because the only thing Liguria taught was typing and shorthand. That's the  only class

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:45-0:21:53
 you had.  And what memories do you have of those teachers, of those nuns? Were they kind or more on the  severe side?

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:53-0:22:42
 No, no. None of them were... They were all serious, I know that. They were all serious.  And a couple of them had a pretty good sense of humor. You know, but they never gave you a hard time.  Even if you got out of line, you went into the principal's office  and Sister David would of course chew your butt upside down.  You know, she'd never threaten anything.  But no, they were all really good nuns and they were good teachers and they really knew their business.  I've never seen They were all really good nuns and they were good teachers and they really knew their business.  I've never seen, except for the one nun I told you about that incident,  about when I knocked Sister Gregory's flower pot.  Do you mind repeating?  That was the only time I ever saw a nun get mad.  Okay.  In all my four years, that was the only time that she...  And you were a freshman at that time?

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:42-0:22:45
 Yeah, I was a freshman.  And you told me that you were playing with a friend of yours.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:45-0:22:48
 Yeah, Eddie Brennan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Eddie Brennan.

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:48-0:22:50
 And you guys were playing together.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:50-0:23:19
 Yeah, well, we were in class. Class hadn't started yet.  And we were just horse playing, you know, kind of shoving each other around.  So she had this pot on the windowsill, and the window was open.  So Eddie kind of gave me a shove and I went over the window  and I knocked the pot off and it fell down two stories and broke on the cement. And that's  the only time I ever saw any nun really get personally mad. In fact, she came over and  slapped my face.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:19-0:23:22
 Wow. And so do you remember which of the nuns she was?

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:22-0:23:27
 It was Sister Gregory.  Sister Gregory.  Yeah, hell, I'll never forget her.  Are you kidding?  When and how?

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:27-0:23:39
 I know that it's a long time ago and you were very young, but do you have a sense of like  how old those nuns could have been?  Are we talking about like your parents' age?  Older than that?

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:39-0:24:10
 Yeah, they were probably, I would say, 30s and 40s.  Okay, so not that old.  I think Sister David might have been in her early 50s. I'm trying  to think, was there an old one there? I think Sister Jordan was the oldest one. She might  have been in her late 50s or early 60s. I don't think any of them were in their 20s.  I think probably most of them were in their 30s and 40s. That's my recollection. Mary and the girls would probably know more

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:10-0:24:20
 about that than I do. I have a question about St. Mary's and the  people that would go to St. Mary's. St. Mary's was, and still is, a Catholic high school,

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:20-0:25:14
 but it was also open to non-Catholics. Oh yeah, anybody. It was open to anybody, but whether you were Catholic or not, you  had to take the religion class.  You had to take it anyway, so there was a religion class.  And you had to go to church when the whole school went to church. That was the agreement  when you signed up. This kid, Bob Sherwood, was a very religious guy. After he got out of college, he became a Protestant  minister. I think he's living up in Grass Valley someplace. I don't know if he's still  alive. But anyway, during religion class, Sister David used to teach religion class. Bob Sherwood challenged her on almost every one of the Catholic teachings  and he really made some pretty good points. Of course, Sister David countered and it was

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:14-0:25:19
 fun to watch the two go at it. Sister David would let the student engage

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:19-0:25:53
 her. She wouldn't stop him, say, what you say, shut up, don't... Oh, no, no, no, no. They used to have a discussion one-on-one, you know.  There was none of that. They could say whatever they wanted.  You know, especially the non-Catholics that challenged her.  She'd listen to them and she'd answer them back and they'd answer her.  Sherwood was... he was famous for that.  In almost every religion class that I had that he was there.  He was always in there.  But we never went to religion class every day, maybe once a week or twice a week or  something like that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:53-0:25:58
 So do you remember to have taken any class with Richard?

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:58-0:25:59
 Any what?

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:59-0:26:01
 Have you taken any class with Richard?

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:01-0:26:09
 With Richard?  Yeah.  Oh yeah, I think he was in mechanical drawing and he might have been in algebra and some of those classes. So do you remember if he

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:09-0:26:13
 was already brilliant at that point? Because later he became a very brilliant student when

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:13-0:26:16
 he was a... Oh, you mean Richard Montag? Richard Montag. Oh yeah, I thought you were talking

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:16-0:26:20
 about Sherwood. No, no, Richard Montag. Sorry, Richard Montag. Have you taken any class where

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:20-0:26:52
 there was Richard Montag in? Yeah, I think I took an algebra class  with him in geometry. Was he good at those? Oh, he was smart. He was already clear that  he was smart. I think he was probably one of the smartest in our whole senior class.  He got straight A's, you know, and he made that honor society every month from a freshman through our senior year. And you had to get all A's  and some B's I think to make it. I think Rich was probably a straight A student.

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:52-0:26:55
 Yeah, I checked his transcripts.  Was all A's?

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:55-0:27:08
 All A's.  Yeah, that's what I said. That's what I remember about him. He was the smartest guy in the  school. And he played the piano well. The only thing is, he just didn't socialize much or go out  with girls.

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:08-0:27:19
 Yeah, based on what you remember, based on my experience in high school, I remember that  there were two kinds of people that didn't socialize. There were the people that were  very, very shy. Those that are very, very shy.

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:19-0:27:20
 I think Rich might have been shy.

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:20-0:27:33
 And then there are people that just feel like, you know, how can you describe that?  One that says, hmm, you are not good enough for me.  Okay?  You know, those people that have that kind of attitude of like, I'm way above you so  I don't want to interact with you.

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:33-0:28:28
 Oh, no, nobody ever had an opinion about Rich like that.  I think we probably figured out, well, you know, he's probably really shy and wasn't interested in going out with girls or going to dances.  But never did anybody ever think that he was different or he was a bad guy and you'd want to associate with him.  You'd be lucky if he would have you as his friend to tell you the truth.  Really?  He really would, yeah.  We got along really good. He wanted to go  to the store with me. In algebra, I think I even had him help me with algebra a couple  of times. Guy was smart. I think Mary and Bernice and Benny will tell you the same thing.  They might have thought that he was probably the smartest one in the whole class too.

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:28-0:28:40
 I was intrigued by what you told me about that day that you guys went to the store together.  Oh yeah.  I was wondering, so one of the tasks that you guys did together was to arrange things on shelves?

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:40-0:29:15
 Yeah, yeah. Whenever any of the inventory was low, we went in the back room  and got the, like if we're stacking canned corn or soda pop or whatever it was, we used  to go in the back room and get the case and bring it out to the chef and take it out of  the case and mark the price on it and put it on the shelf. So Rich helped me take it  out of the case and I said, you mark the price, your handwriting is better. So he used to mark the prices on the cans or whatever  it was we were stacking. Because later on in his life, you see when

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:15-0:30:56
 his mind develops, you see a great fascination for everything that is organized and systematic.  Oh yeah. Everything that has a rule. Oh yeah. You know, in his  own job and academic achievement, but also in other things. For example, a friend told  me that when he got married, Richard was at the wedding, and at a certain point, this  friend of Richard, he was very much into Scottish dance. Oh. And so Richard was not familiar  with it. And you know, Scottish dance is one of those dances  that you do in a group using very geometric patterns.  And Richard got completely obsessed with it,  fascinated, wanted to learn the rules,  and got himself engaged.  Like he tried to dance following the rules.  So there is this fascination for like  these geometric regular patterns.  Was this in college? this was after college after college it was 1969 so Richard was 38 at that  point yeah he was already a professor at UCLA and that the guy was a young  visiting professor that came to UCLA to study with Richard during his sabbatical  right and so they became very close and actually at UCLA this young professor also found his new wife, his first wife,  and they got married and Richard was invited at the wedding in Los Angeles.  Oh. And that's where, and both, this young professor, his name is Max, and both  Max and his wife were very much into Scottish dance. Richard didn't know about  it. When they saw, When he saw them dance, he  asked, how does it work? So Max explained to him the rules, and Richard was totally  fascinated, memorized the pattern, wanted to follow the pattern.

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:56-0:30:57
 Really, good for him.

SPEAKER_01: 0:30:57-0:31:00
 Yeah, he was very much into it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:00-0:31:15
 Well, I think, I was saying, I thought when we went over to the store after school, he  was really excited about it.  You know, he'd never done anything like that before.  And man, he was all smiles, you know, and he enjoyed that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:31:15-0:31:27
 So one thing I want to ask you, since you were very much into sports and you have an  idea and I see that the yearbook spends quite a bit of pages on sports and activities.  How important was sports at St. Mary's in those years?

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:27-0:32:56
 Well, it was pretty important.  We really had a small amount of students.  Some of the teams we fielded, like the basketball teams, were really good.  When I was there playing football, our football teams were not very good because we never had that many guys going out for them.  You know, some of our teams, I remember going to Dawes Palace, playing Dawes Palace, and we only had 20 guys.  You know, we never had the volume of players or just a lot of guys wanted to go out and play.  And we never won a lot of guys wanted to go out and play and we never  won a lot of games. Football games. Now basketball was different. We had some  great basketball athletes like the Toso twins and Glenn Miller. They were  terrific. In fact one of the Tosos was inducted in the Hall of Fame,  the Athletic Hall of Fame. And so we had championship basketball teams.  And baseball teams, we had a pretty good team.  Tosos were also outstanding in baseball.  We probably won more games than we lost.  But I think for the people that participated in it,  it was important.  You know, we always get a nice little write-up in the  Stockton Record about the team, whether we won or lost. At least the athletes were tickled  pink to see that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:32:56-0:33:01
 So, first of all, what was your favorite sport?

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:01-0:33:16
 Football. I love football. I played football and basketball.  I tried baseball in my freshman year.  I didn't care for baseball.  I only played baseball one year.  But I played basketball and football for three years.

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:16-0:33:25
 So if you were an athlete like you,  would St. Mary's give you fellowships?  Or you had to pay the regular fees?

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:25-0:33:31
 Yeah, there was no scholarship, not for St. Mary's athletes, absolutely not.

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:31-0:33:39
 And so do you remember, because I'm trying to get a sense of how difficult it was for  a family to send a kid to St. Mary's, do you remember if St. Mary's was expensive?

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:39-0:34:38
 It was a private school, but was it expensive? Well, no, actually, there were seven of us kids  that went to St. Mary's High School. And when my older sister and brother started, I think  the tuition was like $3 a month. Oh, each? Each. $3 a month each. Okay. Then when my other two sisters... No, in fact, I think it was $2 because when my other sisters...  There was my brother and myself and my two sisters, there was four of us in high school  at the same time.  Okay.  So my mother went and met with Monsignor McGough and said, you know, we can't...  My parents didn't have a lot of money in those days. They said, well,  we really can't pay a lot of tuition. So he says, okay, uh,  says can you pay $6 a month for all four?  That's what they paid. They paid $6 a month.

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:38-0:34:42
 So the regular, you thought it was like $2 or $3 a month?

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:42-0:35:03
 Yeah. When, when, when my oldest sister started, it was something like that.  Two or three.  I know, it was a lot less than six dollars because that was the max that they ever paid.  Oh, wow.  And of course, when my oldest brother graduated, they never reduced the tuition, it was still six bucks.  You know, and when my two sisters graduated, it was still six bucks.  So, that was fair.

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:03-0:35:30
 Yeah, you know, it's a bad point. It. That was fair. Yeah, you know, at that point it was the family contribution.  Yeah, so that was good.  I see, I see.  And so, going back to the playing sports, if you were a guy in St. Mary's and you were  not playing sports, first of all, the majority of guys at St.  Mary's played sports or it was just a little group, an elite and the others were not?

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:30-0:35:38
 No, not the majority. Just the boys that liked athletics played sports and that was not the

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:38-0:35:52
 majority. In fact, it was surely a minority. Did you guys also have teams, what are called, the teams that don't compete with other schools,  but just with...

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:52-0:35:55
 Intermural.  Intermural, yes.  That's what I was telling you.

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:55-0:36:03
 Rich was on an intermural team one year.  Do you remember what kind of sports that could have been?  It was softball.  Did you convince him, or it was just a...

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:03-0:37:18
 No, no, I don't...  You know what? I don't really know why he decided to play, but he only played one year.  We used to play just the other classes, like the seniors played the juniors. They had a regular little tournament or something set up so you played every other team.  Whoever won the most, I guess, was a school champ. So in our junior year, we had a terrific softball pitcher. Now he became pro after he graduated, made the big time. And we were juniors there and this guy's name was Bill Simone.  And when he pitched, the seniors, they had all the good athletes, the Tosos and Miller  and Arby.  All the good athletes were seniors when we were juniors, but we had the one pitcher.  So the softball pitcher, when we played the seniors, the softball pitcher didn't let  them get one hit.  So we beat them good.  So we became, actually, we became intramural champions that year.  We were juniors.  Wow, juniors.  Yeah.  And I remember, I don't think we were champions when we were seniors.

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:18-0:37:20
 But Richard joined you guys when he was a senior.

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:20-0:37:26
 I don't know, you know, I'm not really sure what year he played.  It might have been junior, senior, I'm really not sure.

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:26-0:37:31
 But do you remember, were you in the very same team when he played in the softball team?  Do you remember him being in the team?

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:31-0:37:41
 Yeah, we had to be, but I don't really remember Rich actually getting in and playing a lot,  you know. I just don't remember, you know, I wish I could answer that, but I just can't

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:41-0:37:46
 recall that.  Do you remember, was Richard kind of clumsy? With his body?  I mean, you were not...

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:46-0:38:32
 Well, he was not athletic.  Yeah, okay.  You know, I don't know, he was...  I hate to say he kind of moved, you know, like a feminine or something,  but not really.  He's just not athletic and he never got, you know,  I don't think he ever did any of the exercises that the athletes did. I'm surprised. I don't  even remember him riding his bike to school, to tell you the truth. I don't know. I don't  think he was very athletic at all, for whatever reason. I don't think he ever got involved  in athletics except for that, just that one year.  And I probably played out in the outfield somewhere and I don't remember him getting  up at bat or anything.

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:32-0:38:38
 So I have one question that has to do with before St. Mary's.  Do you remember which school did you go to before St. Mary's?

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:38-0:38:40
 Well, I went to a public school.

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:40-0:38:41
 Yeah, and do you remember the name of that public school?

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:41-0:39:04
 Oh yeah, I went to, it was in Stockton, it was Lincoln Grammar School,  one to sixth grade, and then I had to go over to Jefferson School, through the seventh and eighth grades.  So, I had to go six years to public school, and then two years to public school,  then we went into St. Mary's Catholic School.

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:04-0:39:28
 One question that I have for you is, do you remember if at that time in Stockton, because  I got the transcripts and the transcripts of the St. Mary's transcripts say the school  where you come from. It says where previous training, it's under the label previous training  that indicates which school the student was coming from. And in the case of Richard, they wrote El Dorado.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:28-0:39:54
 Well, El Dorado was a public school.  So, El Dorado was a public school?  Oh, yeah. It's on the corner of Harding Way and Pacific Avenue.  So, a public school similar to the one you went?  No, El Dorado was an eight-year school.  From first to eighth grade?  Yeah, because that's where my daughter went when she was younger.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah, that was a full eight-year school.  Okay.  So he came from Eldorado. I didn't know that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:54-0:40:44
 Well, actually, I think what happened is that I know for sure that up to a certain grade he went to Jackson School.  You know, Jackson School was a... I think it was from one to eighth grade grade but it was south. It was in south  yeah Jackson. Jackson Grammar School was in south. Yes and the parents were living there  Montague Richard lived there with the parents until until he was 10 or 11. Oh  okay. Then they moved very close to St. Mary's but that was before it was like  19... So that was in the El Dorado school district. Eldorado School District, now it makes sense why.  So probably he went for like four or five grades, he went to Jackson, sorry, what's it  called?  Yes, Jackson School, when they were living there.  Right.  Then the family, I think, became a little bit wealthier, was able to buy a, I guess,  you know, the neighborhood got better because it's close to St. Mary's.  Oh yeah, Eldorado School is a good neighborhood.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:44-0:40:45
 They have some nicer homes

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:45-0:41:35
 out there. In fact, they got a home. They used to live in what's called a duplex. You  know what street that was on? Yes. Let me see. I have the map in my mind. It's two blocks  from Jackson, from where Jackson School used to be. Oh, you mean in South Stockton when they lived down South Stockton?  No, the house where they end up going is, was right next to the Church of the Annunciation,  is on a street called Van Buren.  Oh yeah, Van Buren.  It's like, I went to see it, you know, and now Van Buren, there's this square in front  of the Church of of Annunciation, and  they built that medical facility.  And so the house used to be in, where now there is one of the medical facilities.  There is a part of Van Buren...

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:35-0:41:44
 Well, now, wait.  Now, I don't think we're talking about the cathedral of Annunciation.  I don't think there's a medical facility across the street from that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:44-0:41:49
 There is, okay. If you are at the entrance of the church, there is one on the right.

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:49-0:41:50
 Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:50-0:42:19
 Because to the right there is a big medical facility.  Oh, okay.  Over on that side.  And if you cross the square, on the other side, there is something like, is like medical  offices.  Right.  Okay, I thought you were talking directly across the street from the main entrance.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  So if you cross the square, like, there are these medical offices that are right on  the corner. And I think there were at least two or three homes there. And I think the  Montague's home was, if not the last one, the one before the last one. So the house  got destroyed. But the neighborhood was that neighborhood, which was definitely better  than the previous neighborhood.

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:19-0:42:27
 Oh, yeah, yeah. They had some nice houses. Of course, in those days, during the 40s, those were really nice houses.

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:27-0:42:33
 So where did your family live at that time? When you were going to the Annunciation, sorry, to St. Mary's?

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:33-0:43:13
 Well, we lived on East Main Street in Stockton, which isn't even close to St. Mary's. We had to take a bus and transfer once.  Oh, wow. and transfer once. So we lived in the 1400 block on East Main, just a block off of Wilson Way.  I'm telling you about my parents' market. Well, Wilson Way was one block from where we lived.  But if you go north about a mile and a half, or maybe two miles, that's where the store was. I think  it was like in the 1700 or 1800 block, I'm not sure. But it's two blocks north of Harding

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:13-0:43:15
 Way. So when you guys were going to school, you

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:15-0:43:19
 would take the bus? We'd take the bus, oh yeah, we'd take the

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:19-0:43:22
 bus. Was there anybody that was going to school

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:22-0:43:39
 by car? Well, in high school there was.  Yes, in high school.  Yes, there was.  Charlie Rissow was, and one of the Wallaces, I forget which one.  In fact, there was a picture in the yearbook of a couple of cars that were parked next  to the school.

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:39-0:43:42
 I was wondering.  Yes, so those could have been students' cars.  Yes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:42-0:44:17
 You want me to go get those and show you?  Yes, sure, sure, sure. I'll show you which ones are war.  I know Charlie Rizzo had his own car. Their parents owned a real nice restaurant so they were considered really wealthy.

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:17-0:44:29
 Additionally, Ed, about being wealthy, do you have a sense of the people that were at  St. Mary's,  as far as the economic status was concerned, was there variation?

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:29-0:44:37
 Yeah, actually most were just low income and then there were some pretty well off people  and then there was a lot of middle class.

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:37-0:44:39
 Middle class, okay, so it was really a mix.

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:39-0:45:22
 Okay, now this Jeep in here belonged to a guy named Peter Marengo.  Oh. A student?  Yeah, he was a student.  So he had the car.  That's another car, clearly.  Yeah, I don't...  Well, that was Elodie Russell. That was her parents' car.  That's Elodie Russell.  And that's her parents' car.  In fact, I think that's one of those gals is Bernice Perrini.  Then I'm going to meet her tomorrow.  Tomorrow, yeah.  You know, this was like a senior did she?  Yeah, that looks like it.  And this, Harold Tardio was a junior.  When we were seniors.  And this was Harold's car.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:22-0:45:24
 He used to drive to school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:24-0:45:40
 So what's his last name again, Harold?  Tardio. T-A-R-D-O.  Yeah, I think I saw it.  Let me see again.  That's another car there.  Yeah, but I don't know.  I don't know whose car that is.  I don't know if it belonged to one of the gals.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:40-0:45:48
 Actually, Ed, can I ask you about driving?  Was it common in those days  for a woman to drive or was  it mainly a man activity? No, no, yeah, girls could drive.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:48-0:46:41
 Okay, we'll take the driver. Yeah, girls could drive, they didn't have  any problem. Let's see, I thought there was another car  in here. A Charlie Rissow. I don't remember seeing that. Now these are two girls here, let's see.  Yeah, I'm not sure whose car that is there.  You know, it might have been one of these gals.  That's, that's Frances Chisholm was in our, she was in our class.  Uh-huh.  And Nadine Presto, she was, she was a year behind us, I believe.  There's Peter Marengo. There's Bill McFaul, I believe. You talked to Bill.  Yes.  They're non-Gambonese.

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:41-0:46:46
 Ah, yes, yes, yes. I remember, he looks like he's a graduation teacher.

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:46-0:46:48
 You told me he passed away, did you verify that?

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:48-0:46:50
 I went to check...

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:50-0:46:55
 Because we were really good friends, and it, well...  I know his sister would have called me if...

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:55-0:47:19
 Let me show you what it's based on.  So, this is what I got from St. Mary's.  When I went to St. Mary's, you know, they have the class...  Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, and so I I went to St. Mary's, you know, they have the class Oh yeah, yeah.  Okay. And so I went through and I noticed that, you see, when they gave me this copy,  it was already written on their copy, probably this copy goes back to 2013. And so, well,  then when they got some updates, they wrote, and that's what they wrote, they wrote Gamboni.

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:19-0:47:34
 Man, I've got to ask Mary. I think I'll call Mary tomorrow and find out.  See, in the very same way, I believe this is your brother, is it correct? Oh, Jim.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, but Jim died a couple of years ago.

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:34-0:47:38
 Yeah, so three years. So you see how they, when they hear about the news, they update it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:38-0:47:42
 So I think that's the way they...  So who else do they have on here that's in our class?

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:42-0:48:08
 May, like, Perano. Don Perano. around a lot on died here last year the year  before and then to come  uh... not so this is the next class that's that and i saw that they they  they they're your classes don't get money and and uh... don't know that's  that's the only one that were marked  one thing that will be seen the one that you see the pencil of the pencil is  i send them letters at the address that is here and i got it back

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:08-0:48:09
 on possible to go

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:09-0:48:22
 i gotcha so i wrote bob sherwood it is address in nevada city nevada city  that you know  when you get it back to that doesn't mean much you could have moved to a  different place here like two years ago there is no forwarding information

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:22-0:48:25
 anymore so maybe he passed and nobody knew about it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:25-0:48:27
 And the same for like Don Stater.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:27-0:48:28
 Stater is gone, I know.

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:28-0:48:29
 Oh, you know that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:29-0:48:32
 Oh yeah, he's been gone for 10 or 12 years.

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:32-0:48:35
 Oh, ok, so they clearly have not updated.  Yeah, no, no.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:35-0:48:49
 That's why it makes me think about Gamboni.  Because he was, this Gamboni here, he was here last summer.  Whenever they come to Sacramento, him and his wife call and we go out to lunch.

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:49-0:48:51
 So it must have happened very recently.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:51-0:48:56
 Yeah, well, last summer they were here and we all went to lunch and they do a lot of traveling.

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:56-0:49:03
 Look, let's be clear. This is all information that I have.  Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe they got confused with somebody else.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:03-0:49:05
 I'm going gonna find out.

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:05-0:49:15
 Yeah, yeah, so just let's... I don't... you know, these are very important.  I don't want, you know, to call somebody and say, oh, your brother is dead,  and then it turns out that he's totally alive and happily alive.  So that's what I know.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:15-0:49:20
 Here's Bob Sherwood here.  Here it is, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sherwood.  Yeah, and there's Gamboni.

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:20-0:49:22
 Yeah, that's the picture that I remember.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:22-0:49:25
 And there's Eddie Brennan.  You're here too, I remember.  Yeah, I was in here somewhere. Here it is. You're the captain! Yeah, look at you. that I remember. There's Eddie Brennan. You're here too, I remember. Yeah, I was in here somewhere.

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:25-0:49:28
 Here it is.  You're the captain!  Yeah, look at you.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:28-0:49:29
 This is our team here.

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:29-0:49:31
 That's your team, yes.  Look at that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:31-0:49:43
 Von Skonal was a junior.  Junior.  Jack Reed was a senior.  So, Jim Daly was a junior.  And George Miller was the only black guy.

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:43-0:49:44
 I was about to say, he looks black.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:44-0:50:04
 Him and his sister were the only two black Americans in the whole school.  Wow.  So, Al Jacobs, he's gone.  There's Don Perrano, of course he died.  And this was, oh, what the hell's the name, oh, I forget.  This is Tom O'Claire.

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:04-0:50:08
 Oh, that's Tom O'Claire, I see, I see. That's Tom O'Clair. Oh, that's Tom O'Clair. I see.

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:08-0:50:12
 And I remember his name.

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:12-0:50:24
 I know his name, but I just got the briefs on that.  Unless it appears here. Because they may actually appear here.  Because you see they have all the different... Oh, Bardini. Richard Bardini.

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:24-0:50:31
 That Bardini there.  That Bardini.  Let's see, who...  Harrigan? That might be Harrington.

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:31-0:50:33
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:33-0:50:37
 Lou Harrington. Okay, I remember that.  Bevilac was gone.

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:37-0:50:43
 And so, Ed,  it looks like most of the students were  white in the schools, correct?

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:43-0:51:04
 Oh yeah, except for George Miller. Okay.  But there were a lot of Hispanics.  There were Hispanics?  Oh yeah, a lot.  In fact, you know, Hispanics are mostly Catholic.  Yeah, that's true.  And a lot of Hispanics and Italians sent their kids to St. Mary's,  you know, because they were good Catholics.  Sure, sure.  So, you'll see a lot of Hispanics.

SPEAKER_01: 0:51:04-0:51:14
 But there were no Asians. I didn't see any  Asians. There were no Asian students. At least I didn't see from looking at them. No, I don't

SPEAKER_00: 0:51:14-0:51:20
 remember. I don't remember when I actually tell you the truth. Because I went through

SPEAKER_01: 0:51:20-0:51:25
 all the yearbooks to see who graduated, to look at them. Sometimes it's hard to see but sometimes it's clear.

SPEAKER_00: 0:51:25-0:52:05
 An O'Gallo is gone. There's Bill McFall. I don't know if he told you he lost an arm.  No, no. There's Rich. He, he was a sergeant at arms.  Honor society.  So can I ask you, what's a sergeant at arms?  Pardon me?  What's a sergeant at arms?  Well, actually it's just a title.  If in a senior class, when you're having a class meeting,  if anybody got rowdy, Sergeant of War is supposed to take them out and kick them out.

SPEAKER_01: 0:52:05-0:52:07
 Tiny little Richard.

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:07-0:52:35
 So for Richard it was mostly honorary. In fact, almost in every class a Sergeant of  Arms really just a title. You had to have one.  Yeah, okay. So you had to now I believe? Is that the one you  said you called or had her telephone number or something?

SPEAKER_01: 0:52:35-0:52:39
 No, so I talked to Jo Bertolucci.  Who?  Josephine Bertolucci.

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:39-0:52:40
 Oh, Josephine?

SPEAKER_01: 0:52:40-0:53:05
 Yeah, and so I'm going to meet with her.  Here's Bernice. That's Bernice. Bernice. It's a little bit tricky here because for women, there they  appear with their maiden name, while here they appear, so sometimes I need to cross.  So the one that I talked on the phone was, and actually... What was her first name?  So one from your class, it was Lorraine Cabra.

SPEAKER_00: 0:53:05-0:53:07
 Oh yeah, I know Lorraine.

SPEAKER_01: 0:53:07-0:53:10
 Yeah, because now she lives in Wisconsin so we couldn't meet in person.

SPEAKER_00: 0:53:10-0:53:15
 No, there's Mary.  She's the gal whose house you're going to tomorrow.

SPEAKER_01: 0:53:15-0:53:21
 Oh, I see.  Because I was wondering, she's the only Mary so I thought this must be...

SPEAKER_00: 0:53:21-0:53:22
 Mary Phelan, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:53:22-0:53:29
 You know that now she goes with her married name which is like Briarley?  Yeah, I forget what it is. Briarley.

SPEAKER_00: 0:53:29-0:53:39
 Briarley, yeah, I believe that's what it is.  Okay, then.  And let's see now.  Lorraine Capra.  I know she's in here someplace.

SPEAKER_01: 0:53:39-0:53:50
 Yeah, I think it was at the very beginning maybe.  Oh, I see, yeah.  Because sometimes if you're in a show or something.  Yeah, let's see. Lorraine, I remember that I saw her, you were here. Yeah, it was Lorraine, close to

SPEAKER_00: 0:53:50-0:53:56
 you. And there was Eddie Brennan. Eddie's still living in Visalia. I'm surprised he's

SPEAKER_01: 0:53:56-0:54:09
 not on your list. No, no, he is. I wrote him but he never got back to me. Oh, he never  answered you. Yeah, so you see, I have, where is it, Ed here, that's the address that I have in Vesalia.

SPEAKER_00: 0:54:09-0:54:10
 Which address you have there?

SPEAKER_01: 0:54:10-0:54:23
 That's the 1829 South Bardo Street in Vesalia.  And so that's where I wrote him.  And I also sent, there was an email here, so I also sent him an email.  The email didn't get back, so the email account seems to be working, but I never heard back

SPEAKER_00: 0:54:23-0:54:32
 from him, so I don't know. Maybe he's not doing well.  Well, he got married again. I'm not sure whether that's his old address or the new address.  Let me go get my...

SPEAKER_01: 0:54:32-0:54:35
 Oh, thank you. If you have an updated one, that would be great.  Telephone, please.

SPEAKER_00: 0:54:35-0:55:27
 Thank you. so No, he still lives on Bardo.

SPEAKER_01: 0:55:27-0:55:34
 OK.  Uh...  Yeah, so it's the 18...  829 South?  Yeah, South Bardo, yeah.  Bardo Street.  You want his telephone number?

SPEAKER_00: 0:55:34-0:55:38
 Yeah, let's see...  559...  Yes.  627...

SPEAKER_01: 0:55:38-0:55:43
 Oh, OK.  559-627...  4266.  4266.  OK.

SPEAKER_00: 0:55:43-0:55:44
 I'll try to give him a call in case...

SPEAKER_01: 0:55:44-0:55:50
 Yeah, if he still lives on Bardo. OK. OK. OK. OK. five nine six two seven four two six six four two six six  i'll try to give you a call in case you need it

SPEAKER_00: 0:55:50-0:55:56
 i get a christmas card from him every year  okay okay

SPEAKER_01: 0:55:56-0:56:00
 unless something's happened between now and then

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:00-0:56:02
 there's the old high school there

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:02-0:56:23
 yes yes i found actually two historical pictures that are really beautiful.  And also I went to see, actually they kept it more or less the way it is.  You know.  Exactly.  I mean it's not a high school anymore but.  It's St. Agnes, it's Catholic Graduate School now.  They allowed me to go inside to take a look but they said, you know, the structure of  the building is the same as it was.  And so I got an idea of what it looked like.

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:23-0:56:29
 It was exactly, the outside is exactly  the same and I didn't think they did much remodeling on the inside. I asked for the

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:29-0:57:01
 inside and said no, you know, like maybe we change, like the shape and the structure of  the inside is still the same. They painted it and so on, but they basically still the  same. So it was interesting to go and see it. So anyway. Ed, I had one more question  and I'll let you free and I know that your wife needs you, but the question is, I know  at least for some schools, maybe St. Mary's was different, but I know that for some schools,  when you join the school as a freshman, there are certain kind of like, how do you call  it, rituals...  Oh, initiation?  Initiation, yes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:01-0:57:04
 Yes, yes.  In fact, there was a picture in here of that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:04-0:57:06
 Oh, okay. Was there something like that in St. Mary's? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you tell there was a picture in here of that. Oh, okay.  Was there something like that in St. Mary's?

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:06-0:57:07
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:07-0:57:10
 Can you tell me a little bit about what was the tradition?

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:10-0:57:23
 Well, here's what...  This was a freshman coming in.  During initiation, the seniors made them climb the flagpole.  That kind of stuff.  Okay.  Or they'd make them do stupid things.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:23-0:57:31
 Like, you know,l or something like that.  But how did it work?  First of all, you had brought them.  Just for one day.  Oh, it was only one day?

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:31-0:57:47
 Oh yeah.  In fact, it was like, if I remember,  just during recess for one day,  and they just went through an initiation.  It was no big deal like some of the big public schools. It was not an all-day thing or an all-week thing.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:47-0:57:53
 Because larger public schools had a bigger tradition?  Like for example, you're thinking like Stockton High or something?

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:53-0:57:57
 Yeah, they might have their own.  I don't know what they did for initiation over there.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:57-0:58:03
 Did you guys play sports against them?  Oh yeah, we used to play basketball.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:03-0:58:06
 Not football, they were in a higher league. So they were good at that? Oh yeah, we used to play basketball. Not football, they were in a higher

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:06-0:58:15
 league. So they were good at that? Oh yeah. Well they were also much bigger than you,  like Stockton High was a much larger school. Oh it was huge, yeah. They probably had a

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:15-0:59:00
 couple thousand kids over there. That's what I thought from what I've been able to collect,  it was a huge school. Yeah, but they had a hell of a football team, and took great athletes  to come out of there and went on to college and became great athletes in college.  We used to play them in basketball, but not football, because our basketball team was as good as theirs.  We never beat them though. The two years I remember playing them, they beat us both years. But I'm trying to think, we were seniors, I was on the basketball team, we played stop  and high there, and we were leading until about the third quarter.  So we had a pretty good time in basketball.  Then they got hot and wiped us out.

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:00-0:59:16
 Still you did well. So, Ed, do you remember if, like, you know, I go back to my memories in high school or  even earlier, and it often happens in classrooms that you have, like, the super cool kids,  okay?

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:16-0:59:22
 Oh yeah, they used to call them the 400s.  It's called the 400s?  They used to call them.  There was a 400.  There was a 400?

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:22-0:59:28
 Yeah, and there was a couple of them in our class.  These are, I mean, like, the top one, you know, like, 400 is like... Yeah, kind of snob. There's a 400. There's a couple of them in our class. These are mean like the top one? You mean 400 is like snob, superstar?

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:28-1:00:28
 They lived in the exclusive neighborhoods.  Had plenty of money.  Do you remember, Rishon? There was a two that we used to call  400. I don't know if Barry  or Bernice would say that, because Mary and Maurice were good regular people.  But these gals used to dress.  In a fancy way?  Yeah. Nancy Walsworth was one of them.  She was a 400.  Well, we thought, a lot of the guys did. I don't really know what the girls thought.  All the guys thought they were 400.  And her buddy, they were inseparable. Every time you saw one you saw the other.  It was Barbara Brisbois I believe her name was.  Yes, let's see. Barbara Brisbois.  Brisbois, Barbara Brisbois, BBB, where is she?

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:28-1:00:33
 Are you sure she was in the same class? Maybe she was in the class before or after?

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:33-1:01:50
 No, no, she was in our class, but I'm just wondering...  Maybe she left, she moved to...  Well, I'm just wondering, maybe she did, I don't remember her leaving.  I know she was in our junior thing.  I thought I had seen a couple of pictures of her in there. I could have sworn she was in here, but I guess maybe I'm wrong. Why don't you ask Mary Ann  Bernice tomorrow? Her name was Barbara? Barbara Brisbois. She was a nice looking gal. She  was a blonde, beautiful gal. She was always well-dressed. Her and Nancy used to be probably two of the best-dressed girls  in school. Other folks had a few bucks there.

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:50-1:02:05
 What about the other direction? Were there people... Sometimes in class you have these  people that capture... Everybody makes fun of them, everybody teases them, or lots of  people tease them either because they are, you know...

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:05-1:02:19
 Well, Richard... we used to tease Richard Huddleston, but because we liked him, not  because he was goofy. But everybody liked him and he was always saying crazy things  and he was funny and...  Uh-huh, like he was a funny guy.  Yeah, he actually was pretty funny.

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:19-1:02:22
 Do you remember if anybody teased Richard Montague?

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:22-1:02:27
 No, I don't think so. Not to my knowledge. It may

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:27-1:02:54
 have happened, but I don't ever remember anything like that. So you interacted with him. Did  you have a sense that Richard, because later in life, lots of people that, not the people  that knew him well, but the people that knew him just superficially, they always labeled  him as intimidating. In what? Intimidating. Oh, okay. And always wondered wondered how can a man who is 5'6", kind of tiny, but intellectually  intimidating. He would talk to you and you would feel like, he's judging me.

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:54-1:03:14
 I could see where that would happen in college. You can imagine that based on...  He wasn't like that in high school. You're never intimidated. Never. I mean, you know, he's just a regular  guy. He's just smarter than everybody else. That's all. No, he would never intimidate  me and I was probably the worst student in that class.

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:14-1:03:16
 But he felt comfortable with you.

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:16-1:03:21
 Oh, yeah, yeah. He was really a nice guy. He really was.

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:21-1:03:54
 Yeah, so, Ed, I mean, this was really, really great because it opened a beautiful window  on this world.  I told you that basically I know nothing about that time.  I mean I know something about his time at Berkeley because I've been able to find a  few people and I definitely know more about his time at UCLA because I know more people,  his students from UCLA, many of them are still alive so I was able to interview them.  There are some images,  some pictures. It's closer to my world and it's closer to our time. But the Stockton  time was completely a mystery until I ran into you guys.

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:54-1:03:58
 Well, there aren't many of us left. I think there's what, like about 20, did you say,

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:58-1:04:13
 or 22? Yeah, this is the list that I found. So basically  around 20-something, yes. And then we don't know for some  of them. And I know Stater's not here, I know that for sure. And then I have a couple of  letters that got back, so we don't know what that means. So it could only be like, I don't

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:13-1:04:28
 know, Don Perano just went, I read where he died last year. Yeah, they wrote it here.  Yeah. I bet there isn't more than 15, 15 or 16 of us around, to tell you the truth.

SPEAKER_01: 1:04:28-1:04:51
 And in fact, actually, while I was arranging the trip here, that's why I ended up extending  the trip, is because somebody who was in graduate school with Richard, who then became a famous  professor at Stanford, his name was Saul Pfefferman, who I contacted three years ago  when I started this project  and supported the project beautifully and nicely  with suggestions.

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:51-1:04:54
 Oh, excuse me, I think that's my daughter.  Please, please.  I'll be right back.

default: 1:05:42-1:05:42
 I I'm going to put this in the freezer.
