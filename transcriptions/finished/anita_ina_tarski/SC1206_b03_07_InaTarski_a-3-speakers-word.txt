AF: 0:00:03-0:00:12
No, I mean, sometimes part of it will be formal, but sometimes the offhand comments are the most interesting comments, so we won't wait to turn it on.

So I'm going to just start by saying that this saying the date it's October 12th, 1993, Tuesday, and this is an interview with Ina Tarski. And I assume that I have permission to write in a book what you're going to tell me.

IT: 0:00:46-0:00:46
Yes.

AF: 0:00:47-0:01:18
Yes. I'll let you know and I'll probably, depending on who publishes the book, I'll probably ask you for written permission as well. Again, those are things that people that you can collect at the end, but are much better to collect as you go along. So anything you tell me today is okay for me to reproduce. And if there's something that... Fine [LONG PAUSE]

So let's get birthdates first. Alfred was 1902 to 1983.

IT:
You know, I'm not sure

AF:
On when he died.

IT:
1902, I'm not sure.

AF: 0:01:42-0:01:44
1902 is the birthdate.

IT: 0:01:45-0:01:49
Is the official is the official, there's no question about that. I don't think it makes any difference.

AF: 0:01:49-0:01:56
What's the other dates you've heard?

IT: 0:01:57-0:01:57
I guess 1901. But in fact, I don't even think that's for sure when.

AF: 0:01:57-0:02:18
But is 1983 correct?

IT:
I think it's '82.

AF:
That I didn't see anywhere. That was just my own...

IT:
And I could be mistaken.

AF:
So you think he was eighty one when he died or eighty? I remember his eightieth birthday.


IT: 0:02:19-0:02:19
He's supposed to have been eighty one. You know, I just don't know.

AF: 0:02:19-0:02:44
That's going to be easy to find elsewhere. Do you know your mother's date? No. Not the year she died?

IT:
1902 or 19....no

AF:
You don't know the year she died?

IT:
I don't keep track of dates. 1989?

AF:
'89 I'll put a question mark.

UNK:
[DISTANT TALKING] 1990.

IT:
1990?

UNK: 0:02:45-0:02:47
Because she died just a couple of days before I left, and I left in the middle of January.

AF: 0:02:50-0:02:53
Okay, good, good. So she died in January nineteen ninety. Thank you. Usually if you have something to tie it to...

UNK: 0:02:59-0:03:06
Remember we went away over Christmas and then we came back? Was that before the first or after the first?

IT:
It was after the first. She died in January.

AF: 0:03:07-0:03:12
So January 1990. Okay good. And Jan, do you know the date?

IT: 0:03:15-0:03:58
Yeah, he was born in December 11th 19...

AF:
How much older, you're in 1938?

IT:
I'm '38. So he must be thirty four.

AF:
1934. So he's four years older. And do you know anything about your grandparents in terms of, you don't know when they were born? Do you know where?

IT:
No, I it's not even known when they were born.

AF:
Do you know where?

IT: 0:04:00-0:04:00
I think in which Łódź.

AF: 0:04:00-0:04:07
Which would be, how would you spell?

IT:
You know I think these things might be pronounced... Łódź is spelled L-O-D-Z.


AF: 0:04:14-0:04:38
But you think your brother has good dates on all these things, so we shouldn't even waste time on those things. Who has all the documents? are they in the bank probably, in a library. The archival material papers...


IT: 0:04:39-0:04:40
You know I think Steve is the person who knows most of that I don't know where that's at. Either Steve or my brother I could ask my brother.

AF:
Is he back?

IF: 0:04:47-0:04:47
Are you going to be talking with him.

AF: 0:04:47-0:04:47
Oh, absolutely

IT:
He's back.

AF: 0:04:48-0:06:20
Yeah you know we were we were away and then came back and then I thought I would just see you first, and then call and then come back because I know he's like that he's had a lot of the papers.

So all that about what your grandparents did and their occupations and where they lived is something you know nothing about or were any of them alive when you were a child?

IT:
They were let's see they were there's one picture of me or one day's worth of pictures and I was like maybe ten months or nine months, eight months. And then they were in the ghetto and then they disappeared from there.

AF:
Now we're talking about Alfred's parents? [Yeah] Okay and what about your mother's parents?

IT:
My mother's parents, my mother's mother died in childbirth. It was her seventh child was. She died in childbirth.

AF:
So Maria was was her mother's seventh child?

IT: 0:06:20-0:06:20
No no no she was the second. She died giving birth to the seventh.

AF: 0:06:21-0:07:08
Oh I see, I see. She didn't die giving birth to Maria.

IT:
And so my mother must have been since my mother was the second, two four six eight, she was ten.

AF:
Okay but that was before you were born you never knew that grandmother.

IT:
No

AF:
And that grandfather.

IT:
And the grandfather was killed during World War one by the Russians. He was shot for anti-Russian activities. 

AF:
So in effect you knew no grandparents.

IT: 0:07:08-0:07:08
No. No grandparents. Well, I didn't know any.

AF: 0:07:12-0:07:19
You just saw pictures of yourself.

IT:
Yes.

[CHILD TALKING]

AF:
Okay you got a radio? 

IT:
No it's a whale.

AF:
A whale?

AF: 0:07:24-0:07:28
Okay. I've seen your mother's name spelled with a J, M-A-R-J-A? Quine, in his book spells it that way.

IT: 0:07:31-0:07:51
M-A-R-J-A? That's a mistake.

AF:
Well I think he thinks, you know Quine is this great linguist.

IT:
It's M-A-R-I-A but she used J because her middle name was Josephine.

AF:
I see.

IT:
So sometimes she would put Maria J.

AF:
I see but she never spelled it M-A-R-J And so she was Maria Josephine. And he also spells Alfred's other name Teitelbaum with a J and Sol says he's seen it spelled that way, but how would you spell it that way?

IT:
T-A-N-N-E-N-B-A-U-M, I don't know where he...

AF: 0:08:14-0:08:30
T-, what's the TAN about, Teitelbaum?

IT:
No T-E-I

AF:
I would spell T-E-I-T-E-L-B-A-U-M. But he spelled it with a J, TEJTELBAUM. 

IT: 0:08:34-0:08:55
I have never put much attention to that thing.

AF:
I'll probably ask Jan all the same questions about details but I just wanted to check on that.

What was her maiden name?

IT:
Witkowski. W-I-T-K-O-W-S-K-A.


AF: 0:09:14-0:10:14
Witkowska. And what do you know about her family background? I've heard in the past that she was from rather, what, aristocratic...

IT:
No it was certainly not aristocratic and it was a family which... He had a meat shop

AF:
The father?

IT:
The father, and they both worked in the shop. But they were well to do in the sense that there was, that they had enough and they had, you know, that they had a household. And that my mother would tell that people would come to the door to ask for soup, that they had never refused. But they were not aristocratic. And she did say that...

AF:
They were trade people.

IT:
Yeah and she did say that that her mother also worked in the store, that they both were busy in the store.

AF: 0:10:21-0:11:05
Do you know their names, what was the first name?

IT:
No I don't just, I think he was...

AF: 0:11:06-0:11:06
Now what do you know about your mother's education?

IT:
I think she had a couple of years of higher education.

AF:
Meaning she went to some kind of university?

IT:
I think so.

AF: 0:11:06-0:11:30
Do you know what she what she studied?

IT:
I know that she studied music I think for about a year and I think she studied I think, she said she taught school for a year or for a couple of years and she worked in a home, or in an orphanage type home or a home for difficult children.

AF: 0:11:32-0:11:37
Then this was in Warsaw.

IT: 0:11:39-0:11:39
Yes.

AF: 0:11:40-0:11:50
And do you know how they met? You don't know how they met? You've never asked your mother how she met her your father

IT: 0:11:54-0:11:54
No.

AF: 0:11:54-0:12:10
But they must have met in Warsaw. You think Jan would know that? Did he asked questions like that?
Were you curious about them as a couple? Did you have a curiosity about?

IT: 0:12:27-0:13:39
What do you mean?

AF:
What they were like when they were young with each other they did before you were born. I'm an insatiably curious person, I always had been, and I became, I actually wasn't so curious about my parents as when I was younger but I did. But some people-

IT:
Yeah these things were simply not taught [Yeah] and I did become curious and unfortunately when I did and wanted to talk about it my mother was no longer able to have a coherent conversation. And so I really feel very bad that I in fact missed out on that but there was no there was somehow no, it just wasn't something talked about.

AF:
Yeah, and they didn't, Maria and Alfred didn't talk about their past, about their things they used to do or [UNINTELLIGBLE]

IT: 0:13:40-0:13:40
No.

AF: 0:13:48-0:14:45
That was one of the questions I wanted to ask was what sort of things they talked about, I mean that's one  the written down questions-

IT:
What kind of things they talked about between themselves?

AF:
Yeah and, well this is getting ahead of a little bit so maybe I'll come back to that. What I'd like to know or what are some of your earliest memories period, not just earliest memories of your father but just your earliest memories.

IT: 0:14:45-0:14:45
Well I was my earliest memories are of the apartment which we lived [In?] in Warsaw.

AF:
The actual physical...?

IT:
Yes I remember the physical apartment. It was no longer my parents apartment my mother, as soon as the war broke out and I was very small my mother moved in with her sister.

AF:
She moved in with her sister?

IT: 0:14:52-0:14:52
Yes.

AF: 0:14:52-0:15:20
With an older sister?

IT:
It was a sister who was two years older who she was very close to who was with a son. And so her sister and her son and my mother and the two of us lived there

AF:
And so would you think that like you're about two that you're starting to remember that, three that age?

IT: 0:15:24-0:15:38
Well I remember my cousin played the piano and there he would have friends over and of course during the uprising he was already in the uprising and the uprising was around '43, '44.
And so it was before that, actually we were already gone by the time of the offense.

AF: 0:15:49-0:15:49
You left Warsaw?

IT: 0:15:49-0:16:09
Well at a certain moment we got denounced.

AF:
As what? As Jews?

IT:
Yeah and my mother on a moment's notice took my brother and I. She put me in an orphanage and him I don't know where, you know these are things


AF: 0:16:10-0:17:13
You never talked about? Did you want to? Felt you should have?

IT:
It was somehow, the situation was such that you never talked about it.

AF:
Once you came here?

IT:
Yeah. So in fact I for a long time did not know why she had put me in this orphanage and it was not until my husband asked my mother why that she told him that I found out.

AF:
Which husband? Ehrenfreucht?

IT:
Ehrenfreucht.

AF:
He asked her why she... what did she say? What did she say?

IT:
She said because we were doomed if she didn't.

AF:
So she thought that was the safe place for you.

IT:
Yeah. So she said "I had to move them." I mean once you got the message that this was so you didn't you even wait at all.

AF: 0:17:13-0:17:13
And was Jan in the orphanage as well?

IT:
No.

AF:
What happened?

IT: 0:17:14-0:18:02
He was with, I don't know whether he was with her or whether he was with some friends or I don't I've never talked with him about it.

AF:
And where did she go?

IT:
But he, I mean he didn't even know that I was in an orphanage!

AF:
He didn't know where you were?

IT:
No

AF:
You had just disappeared.

IT:
I don't know. In fact I've never talked to him about it. It's very strange. I really I would like to I should but I haven't.

AF:
Yeah. So and do you know where she went?

IT:
Well and then she went back to Warsaw...

AF:
So you were put in an orphanage where? Not in Warsaw?

IT:
No it was outside of Warsaw.

AF:
Outside Warsaw. And she stayed in Warsaw?

IT: 0:18:03-0:18:03
And it was a gross it was a gross place.

AF: 0:18:03-0:18:35
A gross. Do you remember how it felt to be there?

IT:
I don't have bad memories from that place. No I mean it was, there were other girls I played. I remember we got packages from the Red Cross. I think that you know considering the conditions we were, we had good conditions we were outside of the city it was someplace in the country it was... I don't have bad memories.

AF:
And do you remember missing your mother?

IT:
I remember becoming very close to a girl there and when my mother came and got me, you know, pleading with my mother to take this girl with us. And we knew that this girl's parents were dead. And I remember that my mother... She said she would have but she didn't feel she could. The war wasn't over yet. 

AF: 0:19:29-0:19:30
Right.

IT: 0:19:30-0:19:34
Well and that's it.

AF: 0:19:34-0:19:34
So she couldn't take her. Do you remember the girl's name?

IT: 0:19:34-0:19:35
Yes Rose.

AF: 0:19:38-0:19:56
Do you know what happened to her?
So when she came and got you was that when the war was over or before?

IT:
It was before the war, the uprising was over and she came, caught me. I don't remember if she was alone. I don't know where she picked up my brother and then we went to .

AF:
when I interviewed Maria Gustavska about this just last month she says she remembers running into you, your whole family on the street in Krakow. People were just finding each other-

IT:
In Krakow

AF:
Uh-huh, on the street. And what a, you know, nobody knew you were there. I mean they didn't know you were there, and what a joyous thing that was for her to find someone or for anybody find someone who's alive and she remembers embracing you all, being so happy to see you, and- do you remember that?

IT:
No.

AF:
I mean this is like right after the war end you said people were out on the street. You remember scenes like that. Do you remember any other scenes? Do you remember actually the physical ending of the war being like the day the war ended?

IT:
No we were well we went to Krakow and we were there with people who we always considered our family but they're in fact not related and we were there for a while and then they found us a place in this empty castle and the funny thing about this castle was that it was right within sight and hearing of a German camp, not a concentration camp but a German-

AF:
Army camp.

IT:
And the Germans were convinced there was no one in the castle so that we had to act like there was no lights and no nothing. And we basically, during the day we did nothing and kind of... and you know the time, I don't know how long we were there but, but that's where we were, after we left Krakow we were at this castle until the end of the war.

AF:
Until the end of the war. So were you frightened?

IT: 0:22:36-0:22:37
Uh uh.

AF:
Were you scared?

IT:
Uh uh.

AF: 0:22:37-0:22:41
More scared than you were in the orphanage?

IT: 0:22:44-0:23:00
Uh-huh. It was dark, there was no electricity there was no... It was spooky, you know, there was nobody around you had to, you know you heard the people out there but you could not be seen, whereas in the orphanage it was just like you know like a nursing school.


AF: 0:23:11-0:23:20
I mean your mother was she terrified or just sort or could you even get any feeling for what she was feeling?

IT: 0:23:28-0:23:51
I think my mother was a person who was very capable in hard situations.

AF:
She did what she had to do

IT: 0:23:54-0:24:37
With kind of, she did what she had to do with no nonsense, no... Understanding weakness but really quite strong.

AF: 0:24:45-0:24:48
As sort of effective, she was as effective as she could be. She did she did things that, she managed somehow.

I mean I always thought of her as a person who could do things. Things that need to be...

IT: 0:24:50-0:25:22
I remember for awhile, I don't know where this exactly in time but it must have been after the orphanage and before Krakow, perhaps after Krakow before the castle or something, where she was a kind of the headperson in a home for women with children. And she was

AF:
During the war?

IT: 0:25:31-0:25:32
This was still during the war.

AF: 0:25:32-0:26:04
Well somewhere in some of the stuff I've looked through already I saw something about what she had done before in World War One that she was sort of a courier of messages. Do you know anything about that?

IT:
Just that

AF:
Just that. Somewhere in my notes I have that a friend of hers, Janina Zabadowska who was, I take it, Ehrenfreucht's sister...

IT: 0:26:04-0:26:05
Who? Oh 

AF: 0:26:05-0:27:13
Janina Zabadowska.

IT:
Oh yeah, Janka Zabadowska.

AF:
Her mother was your mother's friend? Somebody gave me that name...

IT:
that they were friends before... No Mrs. Ehrenfreucht was... my mother knew her only through my relationship...

AF:
With Janka? 
So later but supposedly she talked to her about old time stories if they were the same age. Is she still alive? This is the oldest-

IT:
She's very [UNINTELLIGBLE].

AF:
How old is she? She would be about ninety also. Do you see her?

IT:
When I'm in Poland.

AF:
What's her name?

IT:
Aniela.

AF: 0:27:17-0:27:17
How do you spell it?

IT:
A-N-I-E-L-A.

AF: 0:27:18-0:27:21
If I wrote her a letter would she answer?

IT: 0:27:22-0:27:26
I think you'll get an answer

AF: 0:27:27-0:27:28
That maybe she doesn't mistake...

IT: 0:27:33-0:27:41
She's quite an incredible woman and she's half the time at Janka Zabadowska's house half [UNINTELLIGBLE] And her long range memory I think is still good, at least it was when I saw I saw her a year ago. 

AF:
[UNINTELLIGBLE] both her short range and her long range. She had lived in Warsaw for... she was born in Poland, she lived in Warsaw for three years when she was really young and she thought those were, just before the war, the happiest years of her life because she'd been in a small town went to Warsaw to study and learning about trade and the big city and so forth and forth.

And I just remembered she was very anxious to talk to us when we came back about and then she fell and broke her right, while we were visiting her she fell and broke her upper arm. She was so angry because that meant we weren't going to be talking about all these things, but the day before she said I think she remembered the streets, Marshall Kaska street, she remembered the meals she ate, she remembered-this is all preworld pre World War one, so her memory like that is her memory for detail was just bountiful.

So I'm hoping this woman can help me also. And that she maybe if she met Maria or was in contact with Maria later that they might have exchanged some memories of past times. I'll write and see what she knows. In other words they were contemporaries so they might be able to talk about it.

IT:
Maybe, maybe.

AF:
But maybe not. But I'll send the questions. So do you have an address for them?

IT:
Yeah, I would simply use Zabadowska's, because she's there half the time and when she's not she's, as I said she's at the other sister.

AF: 0:29:35-0:29:40
And so you have an address for her. So before I go let me get it.

AF: 0:29:47-0:30:07
So those are some of your Warsaw memories and your Krakow memories and then do you remember leaving?

IT: 0:30:08-0:30:08
Oh I remember when we came back to Warsaw on top of coal.

AF: 0:30:08-0:31:15
On top of coal? [Yeah] On a train?

IT:
Railroad train. I was carried home.

AF:
Inside or outside?

IT:
Outside

AF:
Sitting outside on top of that, because it's just the sort of thing you never forget.

IT:
And then we came and there were no streetcars yet. Somebody with one wheel, they would have this kind of one wheel buggies where a person would hitch themselves up to one wheel and then on top of this would be a seat or thing to carry things, packages.

AF:
Like a wheelbarrow?

IT:
Except that the person would be in front rather than pushing.

AF:
Pulling it.

IT:
He would pull a car with one wheel yeah.

AF:
So you were inside one of those?

IT:
I was and then my mother and my brother were walking on the other side.

AF:
And where did you go?

IT:
Well we went back to my to my aunt's to my mother's sister's.

AF: 0:31:16-0:31:47
Because that same apartment was still there. So that was now that was after the war? Yes and then as I understand your father got here out pretty quickly.

IT:
Pretty quickly because we were in the United States on the 28th of December.

AF:
1945. And where did you land in the United States?

IT:
Philadelphia.

AF:
Yup. How come Philadelphia?

IT:
Because we landed on a cargo ship from Sweden. That's where it landed.

AF: 0:31:48-0:31:50
In Philadelphia? I didn't know ships could get in there.

IT: 0:31:51-0:31:56
Well I guess that's where the cargo ships went

AF: 0:31:57-0:31:57
I see. And how did you get to Sweden? You remember that?

IT: 0:31:58-0:32:26
By airplane.

AF:
By that time then you're seven years old, and Jan has already, then, eleven. And your mother then, she's born in 1902. She was forty...

IT: 0:32:32-0:32:33
Forty seven.

AF: 0:32:37-0:32:50
born in nineteen two And they so your father was there waiting for you?

IT:
No, he wasn't.

AF:
Where was he?

IT:
He was in Berkeley.

AF:
He was in Berkeley.

IT: 0:32:56-0:32:56
He didn't, I didn't know why he didn't come to us. Who was it who met us? Zip.

AF:
Who?

IT:
Zip. [UNINTELLIGBLE]

AF: 0:33:15-0:33:15
I don't know. So must have [UNINTELLIGBLE]

IT: 0:33:16-0:33:27
Is it Antony? But I'm not sure.

AF: 0:33:28-0:33:29
So he met [UNINTELLIGBLE]

IT: 0:33:29-0:33:34
And we stayed at their house. There were two boys, two sons.

AF: 0:33:42-0:33:47
You stayed there for how long?

IT:
I don't know probably. It's probably a few days. At the time it seemed like a long time. But I mean like my feeling it's only a few months, except that that period of time in my memory it seems long.

AF:
Very long, it must seem very long then.

IT:
And so then we came by train to Berkeley.

AF:
And you took the train to Berkeley. So do you remember when you came to Berkeley?

IT:
Yes I remember arriving at the station.

AF:
Which is it the Santa Fe station, or where? 

IT:
Well I don't know what station but I remember how I came and fuss and people around.

AF:
were there lots of people?


IT: 0:34:36-0:34:37
I seem to remember lots of people they didn't necessarily all come to see us. You know there were...

AF: 0:34:41-0:34:42
Probably many of them knew.

IT: 0:34:42-0:34:44
But we were the first refugees to have come so there's a photograph in the paper.

AF: 0:34:48-0:34:48
You have that?

IT:
Yeah.

AF: 0:34:48-0:34:57
You have it? Okay. Will you try to dig it out for me? Okay.

IT:
First refugees to come to Berkeley.

AF: 0:34:58-0:34:59
From anywhere? Not just Poland?

IT:
Yeah.

AF: 0:35:00-0:35:02
Oh! So there was newspaper. And were you speaking any English at all by then?

IT: 0:35:06-0:35:07
No.

AF: 0:35:07-0:35:10
No. And your mother? [No] but your father.

AF: 0:35:11-0:35:24
What did you think of your father?

IT:
I don't I just remember being  overwhelmed by him [UNINTELLIGBLE]

AF:
scared?

IT:
No [no] just kind of...

AF: 0:35:29-0:35:43
And where'd you go? What did you what house did you go to?

IT
Evanson's.

AF:
The Evanson's?

IT: 0:35:44-0:35:44
I think so. I think we were in Florence Menard's car. I think she-

AF:
I don't know her.

IT:
You don't know her. She was I think in the statistics department.
Anyway she was it was her car and she drove us to-

AF: 0:35:59-0:35:59
Had you been in a car before? Was it the first time?

IT: 0:36:02-0:36:04
Not, it wasn't the first time in a car. I don't know if the first night we were somewhere else but I know that immediately we were at the Evansons. And since they knew we were coming so probably they were at home at the time the two of us and so they gave us half of their house.

AF:
What's his first name.

IT:
Evans?

AF:
Yeah.

IT:
And we stayed there for quite a while.

AF:
Meaning a year?

IT:
No

AF:
But I think by this time it's getting into 1946.

IT:
Yeah they had a house on two levels and they simply gave us that

AF:
Did you start going to school right away?

IT: 0:37:18-0:37:18
I think so yeah.

AF: 0:37:20-0:37:39
Do you remember where you went to school?

IT:
Cragmont.

AF:
You went to Cragmont elementary school? Was it a difficult adjustment or did you make friends right away?

IT: 0:37:41-0:37:41
Well, I think that at the very beginning, oh I was teased and I was beaten a few times.

AF:
Really beaten? Even beaten?

IT:
I remember one time coming with my clothes torn having been thrown on the cement with my arm all bloody-

AF:
At Cragmont?

IT:
-and telling my mother that she should phone, that she should phone the parents of the kids who did it and she said she couldn't. And you know she said something like "Well what can I do? There's nothing I can do." 

AF:
And that didn't go on too long I hope

IT: 0:38:41-0:38:41
I don't think it went on too long. No I don't think it went on too long and I remember in fact becoming friends with one of the girls who was in this group who was before beating me up.

AF: 0:38:44-0:39:27
I'm fine! Would you like more water or more tea? So you went to Cragmont elementary school and then to which junior?

IT: 0:39:29-0:39:48
It was Garfield at the time, now it's Martin Luther King.

AF:
And then what, Berkeley high?

IT:
And then Berkeley high.

AF:
Did you end up feeling American?

IT: 0:39:52-0:39:53
No, I think

AF:
Did you feel different?

IT: 0:39:54-0:40:39
No I think I think that's... No and I think this is quite typical if you talk to people where the situation is that I never felt completely American. And I would be considered more "completely American" by Poles than I would by Americans, and so that I would be considered Polish by Americans and American by Poles. And that's always so I mean, that's still so

AF: 0:40:45-0:40:54
Right.

IT:
And as a consequence I can be neither.

AF:
You haven't gotten a copy of the van Heijenoort book yet of my book

IT: 0:40:54-0:40:55
No I haven't

AF: 0:40:55-0:42:34
I mean that's very much his experience. There are certain parallels in his experience. He was in France but had a Dutch father who was never present. His father died when he was very young. But he had this name van Heijenoort, this was during World War One, and he was beaten pretty regularly in his own hometown for having this strange name and for being alien. He had been born there.

And then so he felt his, he had a feeling of alienation, he says, from his first feelings about himself wasthat he didn't belong where he was. And he started from two years on, much earlier than you for different reasons. And he never outgrew it because he always was in fact someplace else. And when he joined up with Trotsky and then went to Mexico and then was in the United States, it was a long time before he would go back to France, or if he'd gone back he would have been able to return to the United States. So that when he got back there he had been away for more than twenty years and his half sister said "well it was him except he had an American accent" and in France, in the United States everybody all people did was to imitate his French accent and say how French he was and so forth but what she heard was that he was American.

And I suppose your brother, well I'll ask him the same question.

IT: 0:42:48-0:42:49
I think he's, you know

AF:
Older.

IT:
Let him say for himself.

AF: 0:42:49-0:43:30
The older you are the harder it is. Do you remember any of the details of coming over on the ship? Tell me some of those.

IT:
Well there were only I think seven or so passengers, maybe nine. You know I don't remember how many. But you know so we had dinner with the captain and we were kind of fussed over.
And we were the only children and so I kind of remember being fussed over.

AF:
So, it was a fun trip?

IT:
It was a fun trip except that it was a small cargo ship and the weather was very bad and so it was very stormy and-

AF:
Were you seasick?

IT:
Yeah. But at least your accommodations were good, or were they?

IT: 0:43:53-0:43:54
Well you know, it's one little room.

AF: 0:43:54-0:44:14
Yeah. Did your mother say what things were going to be like? I mean did she give you a picture of your future?

IT:
No she didn't talk about that.

AF:
Didn't say "well everything's going to be fine now" or anything like
that?

So you lived with the Evans for

IT: 0:44:23-0:44:34
I don't know for how long I think for I think for several months.

AF:
And then?

IT: 0:44:34-0:44:34
And then

AF: 0:44:35-0:44:41
The house on Santa Barbara?

IT:
On Cragmont.

AF
On Cragmont. Is that where, didn't you have a house on Santa Barbara?

IT: 0:44:41-0:44:41
Well it was the corner of Santa Barbara. Yeah that's where exactly where Santa Barbara... Evans lived on Santa Barbara


AF: 0:44:42-0:45:02
But I don't think we ever saw... We started visiting the Tarski household probably in either 1948 or 1949.

IT: 0:45:02-0:45:02
I see, so that was the house on Cragmont. Yeah it's Craigmont or Santa Barbara went into it.

AF: 0:45:02-0:45:15
Right, okay and then so you were on Cragmont and then you remember when you moved to the house on Michigan?

IT:
It must have been between when I was in going into the eleventh grade. In Berkeley.

AF: 0:45:16-0:45:16
How  can you date it then? What happened now?

IT:
Because I remember being in high school and in high school in the tenth grade and going from the house on Cragmont. And then I remember my first dance and it was the house of Cragmont.

AF:
I see. So your boyfriend picked you up and then the next time it was...

IT:
And then it was upcoming year. So it's even possible what's between eleventh and twelfth grade.


AF: 0:46:00-0:46:00
So you were so what if you were maybe sixteen by then?

IT: 0:46:01-0:46:09
Fifteen, I would say fifteen. Let's see I was seventeen when I graduated so I think I was fifteen.

IT: 0:46:13-0:46:14
'54 maybe.

AF: 0:46:25-0:47:02
I almost remember going to well that figures I remember being at the house on Cragmont more than in the house on Michigan and that would figure because Sol just came here in 1948. We got married at the end of '48, and I think he immediately started studying with Tarski. So probably we would have been start to get invited to the house in '49, and then by 1954 he was away in the army so most of, and he was- [RECORDING CUTS]
