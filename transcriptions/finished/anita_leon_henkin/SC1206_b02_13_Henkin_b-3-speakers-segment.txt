AF: 0:00:01-0:00:48
Listen, any way you want to.

This, yeah... I think maybe one of them is...let me just read you this paragraph that I have for myself:

"To keep in mind always what were the driving tensions and passions in his life (that I've already brought up). What was the spirit and the sense of the life? Is this a straightforward academic life?
Is its scope limited or does it tell us more?
What makes his life more than a run of the mill academic life?
Why should I write about him?"

Okay, I have some answers myself but, for myself, but I'd like to hear some of your answers.

You might just start "why should I write about him?"

LH: 0:00:50-0:02:43
It isn't clear to me that it is possible to construct a fascinating picture of him apart from his intellectual work.

Certainly that was a tremendous focus of his own interest [Right] but immediately one thing that sets him apart from other academics, besides the quality of his work, was his leadership involvement in people's lives. He was inviting people here, he was building up a school, he was organizing an international congress. All of those "get out and do things" something that very few academics do. [Right] So that immediately...

AF:
The empire building aspect.

LH:
But it isn't just empire building. It is the idea of having an international congress of logic. It's the idea that logic is really the basis of intellectual life! This was not just a belief but a passion.

AF:
Yes, right.

LH:
And so you know these are emotions that are connected with ideas. And they led him, as I say, into the real world.

I was just telling you I can't do anything in the real world like fix up things and so on.
But he changed the world, the organization...

AF: 0:02:43-0:02:47
Of the world of logic.
Was he the first one to organize an international congress of logic?

LH: 0:02:48-0:04:19
I'd never heard of it before.

AF:
So he-

LH:
Well you see that first thing that I mentioned, I almost got an ulcer, was an international conference on the axiomatic method. But then in 19-, that was in 1957. In 1960 there was the first international Congress on the History, The Methodology of Logic Methodology of Science.
I forgot the exact title. It was organized in the summer of '60, 1960 at Stanford.

Tarski was the empresario and Suppes was a lieutenant. I had a position also, but it was just to help a bit in the organization.
Actually I was away the preceding year, '60, '61.

Well so this was connected with the International Union on the History, well I don't know...

AF:
Something philosophy, logic philosophy

LH:
Yeah The international union had two branches history, and logic and methodology of science. And he was the president of the whole works.
Yes I believe the first president.

AF: 0:04:19-0:04:54
He made himself the president.

SF:
He founded he founded that organization, yes.

AF:
He had tremendous passion and energy for-

LH:
And the belief that that's where logic belongs.

AF:
That's where it belongs.

LH:
And belief in himself as the person-

AF:
-to show the way.
He had adversaries.
He had people who didn't think that logic was so central, who didn't think his... and how did he handle that?

LH: 0:04:59-0:05:33
He kept trying to make logic... That's something I remember him telling me that in Poland it was, logic was established as a requirement for all university students, for example. Now I know not whether that he instituted that requirement. It wouldn't surprise me but I don't really know.

AF:
In Poland 

LH:
So every university student university of Warsaw had to study logic.
[Right] We don't have such a requirement now

AF: 0:05:33-0:05:59
Here, now. But what were his tactics. You know, in Tarski in operation?
That was a question as Sol was dashing out the door this morning and I was talking about various questions I was going to ask you and he said "Ask him how he operated in department meetings." [Well] What were his tactics?

LH: 0:06:00-0:06:06
He would get up and talk forcefully. What can I say?

AF: 0:06:06-0:07:51
But that was his strategy, forceful talk? [Yes!] He had no other [Devious?] devious or subtle? subtle?

LH:
He didn't need anything else that worked!

AF:
It worked.
He didn't get everything he wanted.

LH:
No, he didn't get everything he wanted. 

AF:
But he just-

LH:
I never heard of any secret plans.

AF:
Not "secret plans" but strategies. You know you'll get this person to do this or this person to do that, or you know. Sort of "end runs", if you will, ways of...

LH:
Within the department politics? No, no.

AF:
You think he was always very direct? He wasn't manipulative in the sense of trying to steer things a certain way, his...?

LH:
Well he was but it was out in the open.

AF:
Uh-huh, that's, I'm including that.

LH:
Open and forceful. And if he didn't get his way he muttered. [Yeah] That's it. And try again!

AF:
Well let's see in Poland there were stories about his being unhappy that somehow he, his status was slightly below girls. And he felt that he wanted to be on that sort of plane. So he complained about things.

I mean, that's not a question of strategy but that seems to me that is pretty- Also that he felt that he should have, there should have been a Nobel Prize for people like him.
I mean, he was just very, very what outfront about how great he thought he was.

LH: 0:07:52-0:08:37
Yes, yes.

AF:
No question in his mind about...

LH:
That was impressive to me 

AF:
And not offensive?

LH: It wasn't modest! 

AF:
Yeah but I mean did it offend you in any way? 

LH:
No... I would sometimes feel uncomfortable because people knew that I was his ally and I couldn't have talked that way about myself or... [Right] I probably wouldn't want have gone on record saying about Tarski the same things that he said about himself. [Right] Not because I didn't believe it but it just wasn't my style to talk that thing.

AF: 0:08:38-0:09:50
Well I think Sol ended up not believing it.
In other words Sol's picture of him is that he is [Not great] not, well, he's not as great as Gödel.
He's not-

LH:
Oh, as great as Gödel?

AF:
Yeah and he's you know he's not... So Sol ended up with a somewhat diminished picture of him. Sol's picture is diminished from what it was, let's say, in his... It's changed. His view. I mean, okay, this is between us. But I mean I think it's not he doesn't hold him at the same level that he did at one point I think.

LH:
I never before had the question of "who was greater, Tarski or Gödel?"

AF:
Yeah, but see Tarski did.

LH:
I see. But I didn't hear that! You're only telling me that now. I never heard it!

AF:
Tarski held these things of status and ranking in his mind all the time, apparently. And felt that "he never had the acclaim" he deserved and, my God, the man got plenty of acclaim, didn't he?

So he never in other words he never had enough. And this I'm sure must go back to some something way back there!
LH: 0:09:50-0:11:28
When yoy said he never had enough, it reminded me that we often see people who collect large amounts of money...

AF:
Who never have enough.

LH: And never have enough!

AF: Right, right. I'm not saying that he didn't.

LH: So yes I see that, sure, he was he was like that. He had a lot but it was never enough. 

AF:
Never enough, right.

LH: Of course his was the greatest ego I have had personal contact with. That- I'm quite interested in the ego from the point of view of mathematics education. Because it is what holds back almost every student as well as every professor in classes and seminars.

They are afraid to say "I don't understand that" or "I don't understand, how come this is so?" lest people think they're anything less than supremely intelligent and so on. And therefore classes function at a much lower level of learning than there is potential for, blocked by ego!

AF:
Because people won't are afraid to seem dumb yeah how many times have I asked a question because I'm not so afraid to ask the stupid question and people will say to me "Gee I'm glad you asked that question." And it's because, and even I'm afraid you know nobody wants to see.
Well what about Tarski?
Did he ask... Was he afraid to say that he didn't know something just in terms of that particular...? Did-?

AF: 0:11:28-0:12:07
Well in these seminars, colloquia he would certainly challenge people. If he didn't understand it he made it clear that it's because they didn't say it right!

AF:
It was never his, so nothing was beyond his understanding, is what he gave to understand. It was always your fault for not explaining it. But, what do you think?
Was it always the other person's fault?
I mean, did he always get it?

LH: 0:12:10-0:12:48
I don't know. I don't know. He didn't, I never saw him say that he didn't understand something that he really didn't understand.

AF:
It was always that the other person hadn't explained it well. So it was always putting [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

LH:
Mostly it was with students that he could take that line. He felt some other mathematician giving a talk-and-talk...

I have heard him say afterward, to me, about some other mathematicians talk that everyone was saying was very good and he would say "Well, it wasn't so good."

AF: 0:12:48-0:13:28
Yeah But on the other hand he wasn't somebody who put other people down much like for example let's take Kreisel who's always putting somebody, really knifing people. Tarski wasn't like that.

LH:
In a sly way.

AF:
Sly or not sly.

LH:
Kreisel and Tarski were very different types of people they appreciated the difference between them.

AF:
But I mean Tarski was not like that.
He didn't have he didn't build himself up at the expense of others.
I don't think...

LH: 0:13:29-0:13:59
But he was very putting down to students in his seminar...

AF:
He was.

LH:
Because he said "you are not saying it well, not clear!" You know? All the way, not holding back! And that's the way he got some students to rise to heights that they might otherwise not have acheived.


AF: 0:14:01-0:14:46
And other students to slink away!

Well the other issue that he was always driving people crazy about was the issue of proper crediting of who... And of course he was terribly concerned about getting credit himself

LH:
Every ounce of credit!

AF:
Every ounce of credit he could get, even from people where it shouldn't have made a difference.

And that seems strange for somebody who really, if somebody indeed has a very powerful ego, and truly believes in their value, then why do you need every shred of something to add to it?

LH: 0:14:47-0:14:54
Well I'm not sure that we have to impute on the personal motives to that.
I'm not sure that he didn't have a conception of an absolutely true history of logic.
I could imagine that he did

AF: 0:14:58-0:16:30
But it was always to his advantage this "absolutely true history" was-

LH:
Yes, that was the part he wanted clearest!

AF:
Yeah I mean so that is a little peculiar that the "absolutely true history" always placed him-

LH:
Well we say "always" but no, there were certainly a few times when he said "No that person who gets the credit should be this other one."

AF:
Yes, but it was an obsession with something that seems beneath someone like him. I would imagine.

LH:
If you attribute it only to his personal vanity, then you could say that.
But if, as I say, he may have had...really he wanted "the truth."

AF:
Why would it make a difference who did exactly, who did what?

LH:
Well, it's part of the history of the subject.

AF:
You believe that... You're putting the best possible face on it.

LH:
I'm saying it may be so.

AF:
Okay it's fair enough. Okay let's see what else we...

LH:
How are we doing on time?

AF:
We're doing alright.

LH:
It's 1:20. How long were you thinking of going on?

AF:
Well I was thinking of doing both sides of the tape.
Are you dying?

LH: 0:16:31-0:16:52
No, but it is possible to go downstairs, find some carrot juice [Okay] and come up and sip it.

AF:
Or we can just stay downstairs. Let's do that you're probably starving

LH:
I'm not starving, carrot juicing is enough.

AF:
Yeah carrot juice, can you buy something besides carrot juice?

LH:
Yeah [Okay] So you're starving?

AF: 0:16:53-0:17:13
No, I'm not starving I'm going to stop this

[RECORDING CUTS OUT AND BACK IN]

AF:
That brings to mind this thing which is a whole other topic, but tell me about Alfred and women and Alfred and women students.

LH:
He had them!

AF:
I know, in great numbers compared to other people, and how do you account for that?

LH: 0:17:14-0:18:16
Compared to some other people, the only other circumstance like that which came to my attention was when I was working in USC.

We used to have a peripatetic colloquium in mathematics which went from UCLA to Caltech to USC. Around and around the triangle. So I was over at UCLA quite a bit and there was someone whose name you will recognize.

AF:
Don Kalish?

LH:
Yes. That's not the name I was about to pull out: Carnap!
He had a seminar full of women students, like Alfred of course-

AF: 0:18:16-0:18:17
But were they his graduate students?
Did they go on to get degrees with him?

LH: 0:18:18-0:18:41
I don't know in detail, but they look like it, yes. They were there just studying with the master.

AF:
Yeah interesting. How were Carnap's and Tarski's relations?

LH:
I only heard respectable things said in each direction. That's all I know about it.

AF: 0:18:41-0:18:55
Right because they knew each other from very early on. But anyway so you've told me that there was another example, but tell me about Tarski and his women students. How do you account for that?

LH: 0:19:05-0:20:40
I guess maybe one called another.

AF:
One what?

LH:
One called another. I mean they must have got something out of it! They asked study to there. Maybe there were personal relations too. I don't know. I've told you I-

AF:
No I'm not even talking about sexual relations.

LH:
Yes, I know, I said personal relations. So I don't know about those things, but certainly they came, they functioned in student relationships and they got out a lot out of it. And many of them went on and got PhDs and had a career. So-

AF:
What was the attraction?

LH:
I don't know other than that as I say what attracts people to the theater?
Answer: somebody goes, has a great experience, tells it to somebody else, so somebody else goes!

So maybe there was this element in it. It seems from my present perspective that it hasn't been easy for women to move along in mathematics.

AF:
No! Not only in mathematics, in logic, I mean-

LH:
So if one person succeeded so, others!

AF:
He gets to be known as somebody who women go to.

LH:
Maybe, I'm just speculating.

AF:
I know, right! But I mean certainly no women went to Church.
How many women students did you have?

LH:
I had some, I didn't have great many students altogether. But maybe half of them may have been women.

AF: 0:20:41-0:20:43
What about Bob?
Did he have any women students?

LH: 0:20:45-0:20:45
Bob Vaught?

AF: 0:20:45-0:20:59
Yeah.

LH:
I don't know. There weren't so many around.

AF:
Yeah I think Sol had one or two.
I mean there aren't many in the first place. So how did they all gravitate towards him?

LH: 0:21:03-0:21:12
I don't know! As I say, I have several and [UNINTELLIGIBLE] somewhat of a legend in logic, Carol Karp.

AF: 0:21:13-0:25:44
Right.

LH:
And then when I got into math education, I had five PhD students in math education and three of them were women. And the fourth was black.

AF:
But not a woman.

Oh, good soup!

Well I mean it helped that he liked women that's true that he did he enjoyed he enjoyed female company.

LH:
He had these elaborate European manners. He would kiss the hands of some women. That he'd only talk to the wives.

AF:
Do you know that in Poland people are still kissing hands and that children are being taught to kiss hands? I was introduced to children, boys, ten and twelve years old, faculty people, the boys kiss my hand.
So it's you know it wasn't his peculiarity it was part of a tradition and I think it's good you know it's good to have it in that perspective.

LH:
But the people here whose hands got kissed-

AF:
Thought it was special!

LH:
So yeah!

AF:
Yeah but that's not gonna, somebody could kiss your hand and you could just as easily go "Eww!" you know and, so it takes more than that.

I always thought he looked a little bit like Picasso, Tarski.

LH:
I can see but I never thought of it until this moment but as soon as you say it I can see that.

AF:
Yeah and that there's some of the same dynamism that was also there and maybe some of the same. You know, I don't think he was as sensual as Picasso by any means but I think there was a sensuality and that was pretty evident. May have...

I always found him as somebody that I wanted to resist, and I don't mean this... He was just too much of somebody who had to tell you how it was about everythingm and I was, you know, I guess I'm too much of that! I'm going to tell you how to [LAUGHS] Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

LH:
Yeah I do know what you're saying.

AF:
That would get to me...

LH:
See I think I also am such a person that can tell how things are, yet and I accept other people to be in the same way. Both you and him?

AF:
Yeah right, but I always I mean I found myself always wanting to argue with him. And how about you?

Yeah and his political views used to bother me.

LH:
That was perhaps a relatively active area of disagreements between us. But we learned about each other, how and where we differed and we left it at that.

AF:
Left it at that.

I guess that's one of one of what I consider a failing that I can't, tend not to be able to leave it at the end. I can I can but not really. It always comes up so... But you were able to do that. I think it's a real virtue.

LH: 0:25:44-0:26:39
Well in my boyhood family there was individuals who felt rather differently about things than other individuals. And I sit there always thought and I just said "that's the way they are."

AF:
Yeah yeah, it's a virtue.

LH:
It allows one to get on with things that are more interesting but...

AF:
Unless you think fighting is interesting! [LAUGHS]

LH:
No, I don't want to fight.

AF:
I know I'm saying it was one thing.

Who do you recommend that I talk to besides the Vaughts who comes to your mind?
And I don't know what I mean I don't know about Steve whether he's going to want to talk to me or not.

LH: 0:26:46-0:27:58
In this brief conversation that I mentioned to you earlier he said he would feel reluctant to share with you 

AF:
His stuff.

LH: His stuff 

AF:
But maybe not his opinions.

LH: All you have to do is ask and you'll get the answer.
You may detect greater or lesser unease in the way he responds and you may act accordingly, however you will.

AF: Well at least at this point we like each other, I mean and I hope, you know, I could I know perfectly well how he feels.

LH:
Of course he had a falling out in connection with that Intelligencer article with Verena Dyson.

AF:
Did he?

LH:
Yeah. 

AF:
Because?

LH: I don't know. They were, at one time they were going to collaborate and then they had this falling out.

AF: But I mean it remained bitter?

LH: Well at any rate it caused them to publish separately rather than together.

AF:
Which is a good thing because

LH:
Well but, I wouldn't say bitter, but

AF: but did she publish a separate thing finally?

LH:
Yes, yes I believe so I believe so.

AF: 0:27:58-0:30:05
I'll have to be- I'm in touch with her about other stuff, so I'll have to be in touch with her. When did she know Tarski?

LH:
She's spent several years here!

AF:
Yeah, in Berkeley?

LH:
Yes, oh yes.

AF:
They probably had an affair. 

LH:
[LAUGHS] I don't know-

AF: I bet you, I bet ya.

LH:
I mean how do you how do you compute probabilities in this scenario?

AF:
You know because she's somebody who's easy in that sort of matter, it's no big, big deal with her.

LH:
How do you know something like that?

AF:
I just know! I know about her liaisons with other people.

LH:
I see.

AF:
And since that's the case and since Tarski we know is attracted to attractive women. I mean I could be wrong. But I mean it's not at all out of the realm of likelihood, let's put it that way, and she will not be averse to say so: easy, I think. We'll see.

But she- there's this book that's allegedly coming out about Kreisel and she's written about her time with him.

LH:
I see. Who is the author of this book?

AF:
It's a collection of pieces. I'm actually trying to write a little bit and Sol's writing something. Releasing who's bringing them together?

Piergiorgi Odifreddi, do you know who he is? An Italian. So it's going to be a little strange collection of recollections. Like a Festschrift for Kreisel who doesn't want a Festschrift. I mean it's really quite odd but. Verena has written something for that.

LH: Well in a Festschrift you're only supposed to say nice things!

AF:
Aha you should see this thing!

LH:
Then it's not a Festschrift!

AF:
How could you have somebody writing only nice things about Kreisel if you want it to have some verity to it?

LH: 0:30:08-0:30:45
I played a somewhat significant role... There was an article that Kreisel wrote to be published in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.

No article by him had ever been accepted at that time. This was very early. And it had come to some editor and gone out for review and the reviewers said they couldn't understand it and it bounced back and forth several times and then they sent it to me.
It may even have been at a time when I was an editor.

AF: 0:30:46-0:34:29
How, when would that have been?

LH:
Well in the early fifties or sixties? Long ago. [Yeah] Anyhow I accepted the paper.

AF:
Good for you. And?

LH:
The rest is history.

AF:
The rest is history!

LH: He would get plenty new papers out of it-

AF:
Worse and worse!

Well we just received the preface to this thing from Odifreddi yesterday, a fax. He's in, where is he's in Turin or Pisa, somewhere in Italy. Torino?

Not there. But one of those, someplace. And he's part of the time in Cornell.

So his preface to this thing is absolutely lurid! It's worse than anything I've read, that anybody's written. And I don't know if you've heard that supposedly Kreisel was the model for Julian [sic, intended: Julius] King in a Slightly [sic, intended: Fairly] Honorable Defeat, the Iris Murdoch book. It's a sort of common currency.

LH:
The book of-?

AF:
Well it's a very nasty character, and a very Kreisel-ian character. And this ruler, shall we say, went abroad only sparked by Kreisel, I believe, because who else you know would have? And he used to talk about Miss Murdoch, his great friendship with Miss Murdoch.

Anyway, Odifreddi, so in his article on Kreisel [UNINTELLIGIBLE] alludes to this, and then there's something else that goes on in the story about Kreisel saying "no it wasn't this character it was that character." Anyway, Odifreddi has the stupidity to show this thing to Miss Murdoch who says "Absolutely not. This character is not at all-!" which every writer always says. "This is a fiction" and she says "Kreisel is much nicer than this character."

So in this provisional preface that's right out in front there! And I don't know if that belongs, I mean we're supposed to be critiquing this preface, and I think he's making so much of this aspect, Odifreddi, has sort of blown this thing up all out of proportion.

I'm trying to figure out, he's asked for a frank critique on it.
I guess that's what I'm going to say. I've been trying to figure out what to say about what he's got in his preface, because I think there are some very good things in the preface about the contradictories in his character of which there are many, many.
But it just seems to me he's made this kind of the emblem of the differences that people see in this man. And I think he's just... so I've just figured out sort of what I'm going to say.

[LIKELY ADDRESSING SOMEONE ELSE] Thank you!

But where were we?

I'm going to just see if there's any one more thing I want to ask you, and then I'll- Can I send you a letter and ask you to just fill in some little detail, do some stuff that way? If that's alright-

LH:
You can send it to me? Well, let's see what happens!

AF:
Yeah I mean there's certainly going to be things that I've missed because I've hopped all over the place, but... And maybe I'll want some dates, and things like that just to...

But the last thing I asked you was who you thought would be good to talk to besides the Vaughts and besides Steve, if he'll talk to me.


LH: 0:34:29-0:36:58
So maybe it was in reaction to that because I brought up the name of Verena Dyson.

AF:
Right, it was so Dyson? Okay.

LH:
Fraïssé.

AF:
You think he would be good?

LH:
He had some contacts with Tarski in France. [Yeah] I have no idea what he'll say but he is someone, there are so few people!

AF: There are so many people who know him and who know what they think are Tarski stories. I mean you can just, every time you mention it somebody who will say "oh so and so has a lot of Tarski stories."

LH:
Yeah I don't know that I say he has any but he's in a different direction, he's in a different country/ If he has anything it'll be- 

AF:
-different, that's a good idea.

LH: And of course generalizing on this, as a mathematician should, you should get a list of all the people that Tarski invited here over the years [good idea] to spend a year or so here and have at least a form, inquiry to go out to them.

AF:
That's a great idea.

LH:
Of course some of them are dead.

AF:
Right 

LH: One I'm thinking of is Schwabheuser from West Germany, but there's somebody from East Germany who's sure to be alive in kicking.
I can't recall his name at the moment but I know he was here in-

AF:
Where do you think I'd find a list like that?

LH:
Well...

AF: Would the department

LF: In that logic, Tarski room where we were I believe there are copies of the old

AF: Catalogue?

LH: No reports to the National Science Foundation [Uh-huh?] on the NSF project that Tarski headed, in which I assisted him. And every maybe two or three years we would bring out such a report and it had, you can be sure it, had every name

AF:
Okay. What else is in there in that room in the Tarski room?

LH:
The dissertations of various students.

AF:
So I didn't explore I mean we were in that room and I didn't even know allude to the room.

LH: So a lot of reprints will be of interest to you.

AF: 0:36:58-0:37:17
Okay so what I should do is come and spend a day in the room.

LH:
Part of a day, right.
The ideal person to take you to that room is Bill Craig.

AF:
Okay, well of course I should interview him.
[Right] And now have you seen him lately?

LH: 0:37:17-0:37:20
Fairly, yes.

AF:
Does he come to-?

LH:
He's around?

AF: 0:37:20-0:37:36
He's around. [Yes] Will you- he's hard to get in touch with.

LH:
He has a phone, a home phone.

AF:
That he never answers.

LH:
The home phone, well you have to call him at night.

AF:
Okay you don't happen to have that.

LH:
No he's in the Oakland phone directory

AF:
He lives in Oakland now?

LH: 0:37:37-0:37:52
No in Berkeley.

AF:
Berkeley!

LH:
Berkeley is in the-

AF:
Well he doesn't answer a lot but I can call him.

LH:
You have to call him at night.

AF:
I mean he doesn't answer at night either I see.

LH:
Well that's the only way I have of getting him, or you can walk over to his building across campus.

AF:
Where is he?
He's in philosophy?

LH: 0:37:52-0:38:56
Moses Hall, Philosophy Building.
Yes.

AF:
I can write him a letter too.

LH:
And ask him to call you good idea. And leave a message if he doesn't reach you as to when you could call him.

AF:
Right. Yeah he's that would be good get him to take me there spend a day with him.

Okay you know, you don't have Tarski stories? I mean I don't want them today but you have what you would call "Tarski stories?"

LH: I don't think so.

AF:
So there are always people who have what they call "Tarski stories", you know what I mean?

LH:
Yeah. I

AF:
You don't think it won't come right now but if you if one comes you know tomorrow morning as you're waking up note it down for me.

LH:
I doubt it, I doubt I have such stories that will come to me. I haven't been talking about Kreisel, one Kreisel story came to me but you're not writing one Kreisel.

AF: 0:38:57-0:39:20
No, but well someday tell me your Kreisel story. I'll listen to that insted.

LH:
Well and just an incident in which I was involved with him. But it is not for attribution. To anybody! [Okay] 

So it was the first time he came here to spend a month or half year or something.


AF: 0:39:22-0:39:26
You know when it was?

LH:
No.

AF:
He did, I mean I know exactly when he came the first time.

LH:
When do you think it was?

AF:
Well I think it was '55 it was '57, '56 or '57.

LH: 0:39:27-0:40:48
Quite likely Quite likely So I wanted to help him find a place to live and I had a car but he didn't. So I offered to take him around and he said "fine" and as we went he told me that he has a terrible problem with noise. Can't stand noise. He needs a quiet place. Anyhow.

AF:
Cemetery!

LH:
He came to some place that was advertised, I forget where the advertisement was.
Somebody had a room some, people had. I drove there, I went up with him and out came a woman, somewhat flamboyant, and spoke to him. I felt taken aback. Such a woman!


AF: [LAUGHS] Such a woman!

LH: Yes and intervened in the conversation. I mean I asked her things about the apartment and whatnot. And then we left. And then he told me please not to come up any more looking with him at apartments. And I understood that he would have perhaps spoken differently than I did.

AF: 0:40:49-0:41:22
End of the story? Marvelous.

That's great. Oh yes. Well that's the other thing that he straight out front in the preface Odifreddi calls him a "legendary womanizer." There you are. And I mean apart from whether it's out front or not, I don't know that I would describe it that way, even in the back of a book.
I mean he certainly had-

LH: 0:41:22-0:41:26
Most unusual language for a Festschrift.

AF: 0:41:26-0:43:20
Yes, well you'll see. When this comes out, you will want to read it! If you like gossip.

LH:
It depends on the price. [What?] It depends on the price.

There are many things in life that we want but somethings!

AF:
Yeah you'll be able to afford it.

LH:
I would probably wait until the library gets a copy.

AF:
All right. You don't buy books?

LH:
Not, I wouldn't buy such a book about Kreisel as a womanizer.

AF:
No but, well this isn't going to have a lot, this will have some technical stuff.

But Suppes, of course, I'm going to have to talk to. I think Supi's wife is very angry at me these days.

LH:
I hardly know her, is she named Christine?

AF:
She is. I got very angry with her at something and I insulted her. And I apologized, but I mean, she deserved the insult. So I didn't I apologized, but

LH:
In a way that made it clear that she deserved it?

AF:
No, I apologized for she said "you owe me an apology" and I said "You're right, I do and I apologize" but then I didn't follow it up with a letter and so forth because I felt so, I felt so angry about what you said about somebody and I kept I said kept saying that was the wrong thing, wrong thing to say. It was like a matter of principle, it wasn't like somebody making an anti-Semitic remark, but it was the equivalent of a remark of that type.

It was a stereotypical remark about somebody, and I just I really I just felt that... But I don't like it when a relationship is bad like that, and I don't want it to affect how Suppes is going to react to me which I don't think it will be. [RECORDING CUTS]
