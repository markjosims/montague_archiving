AF: PhD in '58?

DS: 0:00:00-0:00:14 '58 and then was two years in Chicago. Got married in '59 and then came to Berkeley in the fall of nineteen sixty. And so that was a mistake because Tarski was too strong and also his influence was waning because the Berkeley department was changing very much. Spanier and Hochschild had come

AF: Spanier and Hochschild had...?

DS: 0:00:40-0:00:40 Come in to Berkeley, brought her, and so they made a lot of moves to decrease Tarski's influence.

AF: 0:00:41-0:01:01 Before that you think his influence was greater? Between '55, '50 and '60.

DS: 0:01:02-0:01:02 Yeah, I don't know all the department politics around, but certainly all those new appointments that were made...

SF: 0:01:06-0:01:06 Was Vaught back there by then? Henkin was there.

DS: 0:01:13-0:01:23 Hankin had come much earlier. Yes Hanken must have come about

SF: Came in the mid fifties.

DS: 0:01:51-0:02:17 '54 or something. Vaught had gone to Seattle, right? And so then when I came back I think Vaught was back and then Addison was appointed about that time. Of course what happened to me in Princeton that was extremely important was that I met Kreisel, we have left out this whole Kreisel thing. But now Kreisel

AF: Was anti-Tarski

DS: 0:02:18-0:02:19 Really did as many things to be anti-Tarski as he could.

SF: The whole subsersive...

DS: 0:02:24-0:02:44 He was totally subversive, right. Tarski had said that at this, I forget which conference it was that he met these young logicians, Abraham Robinson, Georg Kreisel and all that and he found them incredibly "uppity" somehow

AF: 0:02:46-0:02:46 How could anyone find Kreisel uppity? [LAUGHS]

AF: Did you read the stuff we sent you?

DS: 0:02:46-0:03:08 No

AF: You got to read it, it's fun! We reconstruct the whole party.

SF: A pig party

AF: 0:03:08-0:03:09 The pig party, it's really

DS: I have it in my briefcase.

AF: Read it on the way home.

DS: I've been totally submerged in...

AF: 0:03:10-0:03:25 Well read mine it'll take you five minutes and you'll laugh. Anyway, go on 

DS: 0:03:31-0:03:36 So I guess I don't know whether it was Myhill or Suppes who introduced me to Kreisel.

AF: 0:03:37-0:03:40 Well you must have met Kreisel in Princeton when you were there no?

DS: 0:03:42-0:03:42 Well I knew about Kreisel before.

AF: 0:03:43-0:04:08 You knew about Kreisel, you knew about Kreisel-

DS: Probably through Myhill. Myhill had been at Berkley in the philosophy department. Myhill went to...

SF: Stanford.

DS: Stanford.

AF: Right now but you know about Kreisel way before that because if you had read what I had sent you, or what Sol and I sent you, you would see that when Kreisel came to Berkeley in 1956 and called me up on the telephone and wouldn't say who he was but asked for Sol, and then he went

DS: You were back from the army?

AF: 0:04:33-0:04:34 The army, army. And then you had already told us that all Kreisel says is that everything's trivial. And so this man with a strange accent calls up and I say "would you like to leave a message?" And he says "no no no it's completely trivial." So then I knew who it was although he never identified himself. I had thought before...

DS: 0:04:59-0:05:01 I must have known him...

AF: So you must have known him in '56

DS: 0:05:01-0:05:10 Through I mean, well Tarski had had his counters with him before

Af: 0:05:12-0:05:15 You must have been known him in Princeton, he was in Princeton.

DS: 0:05:16-0:05:18 Because Kreisel wrote papers about Gödel-Bernays set theory. Princeton must have had those...

AF: 0:05:19-0:05:19 No he was at Princeton already getting to know Verena.

DS: 0:05:19-0:05:50 No no, don't rush things. That didn't happen until...

AF: Yes it did.

DS: That didn't happen until... I think Kreisel must have come to Princeton the same time I came there about

AF: 0:05:50-0:05:51 Well, '55.

DS: 0:05:51-0:05:53 Fall of '55.

AF: 0:05:53-0:05:53 Right. And he knew Verena and he brought...

DS: 0:05:54-0:06:07 Yeah you see Dyson was a fellow student from Cambridge.

AF: 0:06:07-0:06:08 Right I know that.

DS: 0:06:08-0:06:16 So Kreisel told me that, you know so he was at Dyson's house all time

AF: Right

DS: 0:06:20-0:06:53 But even though there may have been some magnetism there he purposely didn't start anything with Verena the whole first year because of his...

AF: Relationship with Dyson

DS: Old friendship with Dyson.

AF: Right. But he did take her to Cornell in '57 and by that time they were [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

DS: 0:06:55-0:07:10 Oh yes but then, I mean that was the whole breakup that happened with the Dyson's and the next year they took up with each other.

AF: 0:07:11-0:07:12 [RIGHT]

DS: 0:07:12-0:07:16 And then Kreisel was to go and get them at the airport when they came back from Los Alamos, or something like that, to a physics conference. And so when he met them at the airport it was announced that Verena had told Freeman Dyson everything about their relationship right and he didn't want to hear about it at first. And when she insisted on telling him he took her down to a lawyer and made her sign a paper saying what it was. And then that was the beginning of the divorce

AF: 0:08:15-0:08:15 Yeah but the whole point the whole point of this is establishing when you met Kreisel, which was pretty

SF: Do you think Kreisel was [UNINTELLIGIBLE] '56 to '58?

AF: And he was already poisoning you against Tarski.

DS: 0:08:15-0:08:22 Oh yeah yeah

SF: But you had already left Princeton by fifty [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

DS: 0:08:23-0:08:42 No no, I left Princeton in June of '58.

AF: 0:08:43-0:08:43 So you knew Kreisel, you met Kreisel in Princeton.

DS: Well we lived together in the same house.

AF: You and Kreisel?

DS: Yeah

AF: Well!

DS: 0:08:43-0:08:50 So that was where his girlfriend was the daughter of Moss Hart.

AF: 0:08:51-0:08:51 Oh yeah he had Moss Heart's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

DS: 0:08:51-0:08:56 Oh yeah. She was extremely entertaining

AF: 0:09:01-0:09:02 But she didn't live with you two.

DS: 0:09:02-0:09:08 She would just come down for the weekend.

AF: 0:09:11-0:09:12 Yeah. What was her name?

DS: 0:09:12-0:09:22 The Good Lady.

AF: The Good Lady?

[DISTORTION]

AF: 0:09:39-0:09:47 Do you think that every girlfriend that Kreisel has claimed is in fact a fact? Do you think he's ever invented girlfriends?

[DISTORTION]

DS: 0:10:02-0:10:08 Yes, I know he's had encounters

[DISTORTION]

AF: "You wanna [EXPLETIVE]?" And sure enough somebody would! [LAUGHS]

[DISTORTION]

SF: 0:25:19-0:25:33 ...one would also have to demonstrate their consistency and completeness. But if all infinitary methods would have to be justified on a prior basis that could only admit finitary methods. That is reasoning about finite combinations of objects confined entirely to such combinations. On Hilbert's views, with mathematics represented in axiomatic systems and every proposition of proof represented in such a system as a finite sequence of basic symbols, one could hope to prove consistency of such a system by completely finitary methods, by showing that no possible proof could result in a contradiction. This would be done through a theory of proofs and transformations which Hilbert initiated. Again he was fully optimistic for his program to secure all the mathematics by finitary consistency proofs. First for number theory with Peano axioms, then for the real number system and analysis and finally for set theory.

Hilbert's program thus received a big shock in 1931 when Georg Gödel showed that Peano's assets and moreover any effectively described extension of those essence including analysis in set thoery is incomplete if consistent. Moreover the consistency of such a system cannot be proved within itself so any such proof would have to use something from outside the system. In particular any system which incorporates all finite methods cannot be proved consistent by those methods.

How does all this look to us now? It's generally agreed that Gödel's results definitively undermined Hilbert's program at least as originally conceived. Incidentally Hilbert himself never admitted that so strong were his convictions that his general program was the only way to go. He said that Gödel's results showed that it would be more difficult to carry his program through than originally thought.

His coworkers though saw that some modification would be necessary and that in fact is what happened in the future development of proof theory as I'll say something about below. Nowadays the whole preoccupation with consistency proofs as we see it as a matter of central concern. On the one hand hardly anyone doubts that the axiom systems of number theory analysis and set theory in current use are consistent. One reason is that they accord with basic informal reasonably coherent conceptions, whether one is a platonist or not, we have what these systems are supposed to be about under which their axioms are recognized to be correct. I say this even though I don't believe saying this requires a platonistic point of view. Moreover in the past all inconsistencies resulted from very obvious defects of formulation and those defects have been eliminated.

To be sure there could still be hidden defects we're not aware of, but none has emerged even after a massive amount of detailed investigation of these systems.

Also Hilbert's idea that mathematical concepts exist only through them only through axiom systems for them is accepted by very few. Four: given that the systems we use are necessarily incomplete, granted their consistency, no such system can be said to fully determine its subject matter. So we're led back to just the kinds of philosophical questions about the nature of mathematical concepts and how we come to accept and have our knowledge about them. Questions that are just the sort that Hilbert hoped to avoid consistency and completeness programs. While consistency may no longer preoccupy us, Gödel's incompleteness results are still a live matter.

Four [sic]: proofs are the only means we have for final verification of mathematical truths and proofs must proceed from what is evidently true or already known to be true by incontrovertible steps to what is to be established. And when we analyze this picture we are led to the representation of proofs in formal mathematic systems. Every system in use for other than the very specialized parts of mathematics contains Peano's axim. So by Gödel's results it's incomplete assuming it's consistent. According to this line of argument appears that there will be sensible mathematical propositions which we can never prove or disprove and then contrary to Hilbert's general view "ignoramus et ignorabimus" that is "we do not know and we shall never know." Is this conclusion really justified by Gödel's incompleteness results? To begin with let's look more specifically at how Godel proved those results themselves.

What he did was to translate properties of symbols and finite sequences of symbols, including formal propositions and proofs into properties of numbers systematically assigned to those symbols and finite sequences of symbols. Then for each of the axiom systems S to which his results apply he was able to construct a number theoretical proposition A, which says of itself under this translation that A is not provable in S.

Next he showed that if S is consistent then the proposition A, constructed in that way is not provable in S. But since that's exactly what A asserts of itself it follows that A is true, though we can't establish its truth within S.

Now if S only proves true statements as we would want, then certainly the negation of A is also not provable in S. That is A is undecidable by S. In fact, a much weaker hypothesis on S is sufficient for the second part and by a variant argument due to Berkeley Rosser, it's sufficient for both parts to simply assume that S is consistent.

Like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle or the Big Bang or Black Holes, Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems and their self referential aspects have attracted much popular attention. Paradoxical self-reference goes back to antiquity. We still have no generally accepted way of accounting for the so-called liar paradox "I am lying" or "this statement is false" which if true is false and if false, true.

What Georg Gödel did was similar, using provability in S in place of truth. But unlike the liar statement, it is nonparadoxical, there's an escape since we do have a proof of A though not in S.

In his is popular and very successful, although at seven hundred and seventy pages very long book, Gödel, Escher, Bach, Douglas Hofstadter made vivid but loose play with analogous uses of self-reference or self-return or strange looping in the art of MC Escher and the music of JS Bach, as well as in computer programs which refer back to or call themselves in the process of computation. This last use of self-references is more aptly analogous to Gödel's than the others.

Since Hofstadter' ideas are all over the place, that's not where to go for a straight story on Gödel's's theorem. But it is entertaining and stimulating and not too misleading. Other examples of popular bounce offs are the books by Raymond Smallian. "What is the name of this book?" and "Forever Undecided: A Gödel Puzzle"? And one of the most unusual uses of Gödel's stamp is In The Violin Concerto by Hans Werner Hensen, which includes a poem "Homage à Gödel" by, I have to look up the name of this guy, Enzensberger, which for your amusement I will now play a very short portion of.
