HK: 0:00:00-0:00:02
 Would you be averse to a glass of wine?

IC: 0:00:02-0:00:38
 I don't drink alcohol. I'm a strange Italian, I know, I know.  I don't drink alcohol. But feel free, please don't have any problem.  My husband loves me also for this reason because wherever we go I'm the designated driver.  He says I cannot enjoy wine with you but at least I can drink wine.  I don't need to worry because I have a driver in the family.  As I said, feel free.  I mean, I know that for people that drink, it's enjoyable before dinner.  There's an entire Italian tradition with that.  I'm familiar with that.

HK: 0:00:38-0:01:04
 Yeah, we drink that at dinner.  Yeah, so I will also send you the… Yeah, okay, I can also send you that.  (That would be great for your electronic program, yeah.)  And then I also send you the one that comes out.  (Thank you.)  Let me do that now. Otherwise I might forget. Let me goes that one. So you have been now for how long, half a year?

IC: 0:01:57-0:02:07
 In Bologna, I went there in August, at the end of August.  Our students arrive in August for one month of Italian courses.

HK: 0:02:07-0:02:09
 I see. So it's three months.

IC: 0:02:09-0:02:13
 So I'll be there until February the 3rd and then I go back to teaching.

HK: 0:02:13-0:02:15
 Have you enjoyed it?

IC: 0:02:15-0:02:52
 Yes! I mean, Bologna is a very pleasant place. There's been a very hot Summer and then Fall in terms of temperature. It's very lively,  there are lots of students, it's a very international, for Italian standards,  very international, there is a very nice mix and it's also very nice to see. We have 69  students this semester from all UC campuses to see how these experiences  can be, for some of them actually, for a good number of them, transformative. Some  of them, it's the first time they leave the US, for a small number also, the first time they leave California.  And they need to adapt to a different academic system.

HK: 0:02:52-0:02:56
 I see. So these are people who do a year abroad or something?

IC: 0:02:56-0:03:52
 Yes. I mean, most of them do a semester. The year abroad has become more like, you know,  out of 69, we have 10 of them that do the year abroad. The others are just for the fall semester, and then we have 30 new students coming for  the spring semester.  The number is smaller just because, remember, you know, with the quarter system, there is  an asymmetry because the quarter, the fall quarter is roughly, can be matched into the  fall semester.  The problem is that if you are a student in the quarter  system, you have to come to Bologna from January until June, which comes for a semester, but  it comes for two quarters back where you are. If you don't want to stay behind with the  exams, you need to take at least six, seven courses. That's too much in a semester.  (I see. Yeah.) That's too much in a semester. So that's why usually we have Berkeley students, Berkeley has the semester, so we have Berkeley  students come in the spring.

HK: 0:03:52-0:03:56
 I see.  So it's not just San Diego, it's UC, generally.

IC: 0:03:56-0:04:05
 Yes.  The only campus, remember, around your time there was the big change because I think when  you started in 1965, UCLA still had semesters.

HK: 0:04:05-0:04:06
 Yeah.

IC: 0:04:06-0:04:09
 It was 1968, maybe, or 1967.

HK: 0:04:09-0:04:15
 I can tell you a story about that.  Oh, yeah.  I have a free experience there.  It was the first…

IC: 0:04:15-0:04:32
 Yeah.  It was across all UC campuses.  Around that time, there was the change, except Berkeley.  The other exception is the last campus that they created in 1997,  Merced.  I see.  Merced adopted the semester system because they realized that it's easier to match with other systems. So those are the two anomalies.

HK: 0:04:32-0:05:21
  The reason why I remember this is... that was the... so the academic year, 67, 68, was the first with the new...  Quarter system.  And it meant that you had to...  Everything had to be finished about three weeks earlier than previously because that  had to do with wanting to have this full summer quarter.  And it meant in particular that you had to hand in your thesis also three weeks earlier.

IC: 0:05:21-0:05:22
 Oh, okay.

HK: 0:05:22-0:12:52
 I mean, not that I didn't know, but I sort of not really paid the right kind of attention  to it.  So, in the end, although all the...  I may have told you this before too, but I wanted...  I actually had all the main results of my dissertation already by the spring of the year before and decided I was not going  to get my degree because then I would have had to leave and I still had a year's full  financial support and there was this logic year 67-, and I didn't want to miss out on that. So I left all this stuff,  but it still had to be written up, and then in the end, I mean the logic year was very  exciting, but the dissertation and then... So there was this period of ten days,  I think, where I may have slept a total of 20 hours or something like that.  I was really, really in bad physical shape at the end of it.  But I did sort of get it done just in time and it was really terrible.  Because some of the committee members hadn't even had a copy of the thing and they actually held  it not me responsible but Richard. Richard was not entirely wrong because it was, I don't  know if that's part of the story I ever told you. I had terrible difficulty to get him to read what I had.  There was this very long probe,  which was the central part of the dissertation.  And I didn't dare to do anything until he had sort of given his approval.  And so I mean, I think this probably also told you at some point,  but I consider myself having been lucky with my supervisor  in a way that hardly anybody ever could have been, in that he allowed me and he actually  liked me to be there when he did his own work.  And he wanted always to have somebody there as a kind of response and it just happened at that time.  These three years I was there, there was nobody else who could have taken that place.  He had no other graduate students.  I mean at the very end I think he had a lot.  And so he had had two who had both left the moment that I came, more or less.  One was called Cocchiarella and the other was a guy,  Rudolf Greve.  (Greve.)  So Greve had already left, I mean I took over his apartment in fact when I came  to UCLA in September of 65.  And Cocchiarella had left a little earlier, he got a job at what was then San Francisco State College.  But he still had to,  so while I was there this first semester,  he came down to defend his dissertation.  So there was in that respect a kind of vacuum,  and I was the only one to sort of sit in there.  So I was the one who we would then  call up and I would come up to the house and do some work there and very often we would  at some point say, want a break and then I would go to a coffee shop somewhere and continue. And it was also sometimes, but not very often, in his office.  But anyway, so on the whole, I mean it was in packages mostly, but on the whole I got  an enormous amount of hand-on observation of how somebody of that intellectual quality goes about working on a problem.  And it was absolutely fantastic. But the dissertation actually was something that he had very little to do with. I mean he knew  what was going on more or less, but it wasn't a problem that in the first semester, I'd  come with a very different project, UCLA, something to do with semantic ???. But  in the first semester that I was there, I took an upper division course by Arthur  Prior, who happened to be just there as a visiting professor.  And in the course of that course, the question came up, and especially for me, that gave me the theme for the dissertation.  So I was lucky that I could still talk about that with Prior before he went back.  And then it took me from that moment about a year to get all the main results.  So that was in the middle of my second year.  The crucial idea, you know very well, the crucial idea for this prophecy, you know this theorem that since and until was, yeah, it was on St. Nicholas Day, which is for Dutchmen  very important, on 5th of December. And I had been invited to dinner by Lee Lemon. You  know about Lemon, the logician, the ???, what was his first name?  He wrote a book on the introduction to logic which was very much used in those days.  John Lemon.  He had a degree of English, I think, he came from Oxford and had, I cannot remember now whether he already had a permanent position somewhere  in California or was at a point of taking it but he was not very old.  He had a heart attack on a trip to the mountains, I mean a walk, together with this American woman who, I think they  were already married at that point. And so that happened also while I was there, I think the first year. He had a heart attack and died, and so she was his widow and she invited me for dinner and I went there and it was quite nice, and then I went home and I still don't quite know whether that was the wrong thing  to do but in any case it was good for the work! (Because you focused on the work.)  Because that's why I had this crucial idea.  Oh, I see.  It was quite complicated.

IC: 0:12:52-0:13:05
 You said December the 5th, because it was St. Nicholas Day.  (December.)  December, yeah, December the 5th.  Yeah.  So we're talking about 1965 or 1966?

HK: 0:13:05-0:13:28
 Certainly not 1965.  (Because it would be too early because it was still…  Or 1967?)  No, certainly not.  Could it have been 1965?  No, 1966.  

IC: 0:13:28-0:13:35
 Just to get an understanding of the development, because also you took the seminar in fall 1965.  Do you remember actually if Montague was attending Prior's seminar as well?  No.

HK: 0:13:35-0:13:38
 Prior gave two courses.  This was actually not a seminar.
 It was an upper division course.
 And he also gave a seminar which I did not take, and that's something I regret to this, day on existence and that is what gave rise to the book Objects of Thought.

IC:
 Oh, so he presented that in that seminar!

HK:
 It was an extremely important visit because the upper division course of tense logic became past, present and future.

IC: 0:14:12-0:14:19
 Yes, exactly.  I knew about this but I didn't know that he taught another seminar which was at the foundation of the…

HK: 0:14:19-0:14:27
 I think that Montague went to that but since I went there, I can't be sure.

IC: 0:14:27-0:14:34
 So Montague was aware.  So you told him that you were inspired by a Prior seminar.

HK: 0:14:34-0:15:18
 Oh, yeah.  No, no.  I mean, so that semester I didn't see Montague as much as I did on the following years, but I already did.  And you know, he was incredibly nice to me.  He actually, there's this long story about how I arrived in Los Angeles, but he came  and fetched me from the airport and I spent a couple of weeks at this place before I could  move into this apartment, which I  also got via him because he was a student.
 
IC:
 Because he was a student, you're right.

HK:
 So it was actually quite easy.  I remember it was after colloquia, there was Priorand there was Montague and it was nice.

IC: 0:15:18-0:15:28
 That's true because you had just arrived.  When Prior was there, you had just arrived as well because that was the first semester, right?

HK: 0:15:28-0:15:35
 Yeah, right. I can't remember how we…

IC: 0:15:35-0:15:43
 So you're talking about the development of the ideas. We're talking about then Montague, you don't feel that what you were working on was something that…

HK: 0:15:43-0:17:11
 Oh yeah, so I told Montague what I was doing and also I was very pleased with myself when  I had this probe with this area and so forth. And he knew very well what Prior was doing.  And it was after all just the time that he himself also was very much interested in tense logic and I missed it.  Cocchiarella had just finished his dissertation.  And so, yeah, there was quite a bit of interaction between Prior and Montague during that semester. Yeah, so I still remember that it was already in the spring of 68 that I finally on Monday or Tue..., I was given up on trying to get him to read what I had.  I mean the proof was all written up.  That was not the problem.  At the end, the right at the end had to do with,  in those days you had to find a typist  and they would actually type it all in the exact,  according to the exact regulations of the librarian.  And so it was actually a non-trivial additional task.  I mean, I was sort of psyched about,  that was already quite a few years later when Irene Heim got her dissertation.  (Oh, yeah, sorry!)  No, that's fine.

IC: 0:17:11-0:17:23
 Yeah, and then you have to…  In fact, which means that you could not make changes or not change it easily, which means  that the version that you would bring to the typist has to be the final one. It's not like, you know…

HK: 0:17:23-0:17:40
 Well, that was one thing, but so in her case, the typist who knew the regulations, apparently, of the university… She was in Stanford when she finished the dissertation,  but she was a student at UMass (ohh!), Partee.

IC: 0:17:40-0:17:46
 Oh, so I thought it was a mistake. She realized it was a mistake.  She wanted to make a correction.

HK: 0:17:46-0:18:13
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. (The guidelines were wrong.)  So the only thing that ever mattered to a librarian in those days, and they were the  final authority, were the margins.  (The margins!  I know, I know.)  So there was this perfectly typed dissertation and according to Stanford's  specifications I sent it in and they said no!  And so she had to get another typist to get the whole thing typed again.

IC: 0:18:13-0:18:32
 So can I ask you, what do you think that Montague was kind of like?  Is it because he was trusting you and therefore you don't feel there was  like the need for him to jump on the check-in bed(???)?  Maybe he was busy in that period?

HK: 0:18:32-0:19:45
 No, he was busy.  So finally I got him to agree that we would go through this probe together.  So that's it.  Finally in a couple of afternoons.  And I still remember one point where I thought that I'd done something wrong.  I sort of really felt unwell and I asked if I could go to the loo.  And sort of there I, in the privacy of the space, I thought over it and I thought, no, it was all right.  And then I came back and Montague, you asked, "are you all right?"  And I said, yeah, I thought, I thought there was something wrong.  And he said, "well, there was nothing wrong".  There was nothing wrong. We went on. But there's one part of that interlude that I still sort of really... I mean, the system has never forgot that moment. When you have a dissertation,  basically one probe, and that collapses. It gets started over.

IC: 0:19:45-0:20:10
 Interesting. You didn't share this with me, the fact that the way you managed to convince Montague was  basically you guys were together, which made sense in the sense that he had already done  through you, he had presented to you ideas that he had.  So clearly you were functioning as an excellent catalyzer.  In other words, like, you would keep his attention together and you would...

HK: 0:20:10-0:20:14
 Yeah, the catalyzation has very little to do with the dissertation, but with these...

IC: 0:20:14-0:20:40
 Yeah, so probably what happened with the dissertation is that he was able to go through your proof,  because you may have triggered the same mechanism.  Okay, Hans is here, let's be focused on this task. I cannot do anything else.  I had to do it.  Probably there was also an issue of time.  I guess you had to defend,  and without his approval,  you could not defend.  You could not send it to the timepiece.  But who else was in your...  Because you mentioned that some of the people  that were in your committee  were not able to get the decision.

HK: 0:20:40-0:21:14
 Yeah, so C.C. Chang, the logician,  he was particularly annoyed,  and he was not going to sign his document  at the end of the oral until I would have shown him there was a dissertation.  So it was all quite painful.  So then I think the next day I went with an actual physical copy to his office. And it was sort of clear that he was actually annoyed, of course with me, but in particular  with Richard because Richard had organized the oral and so forth.

IC: 0:21:14-0:21:20
 The tradition would be that before your orals you would give your committee a dissertation.

HK: 0:21:20-0:21:21
 Yeah, it was pretty standard.

IC: 0:21:21-0:21:25
 So the idea is that you were there to discuss the dissertation with them?

HK: 0:21:25-0:22:37
 Yeah, I presented the results, but I had no chance to check whether this was right.  It was perhaps that profound, but it was complicated enough for it not to be directly visible that  this could be true. And so he did actually, so C.C. did say yes he was, he acknowledged he was impressed by  the result but I think it was actually good of him to refuse to, although it didn't make  much difference because he couldn't read it at that point either. (But he trusted...) But he trusted at least Richard enough as far as that.  But that was not the right way to proceed.  And the others, yeah, it was quite a spectacular committee actually.  Who else was there?  Yanis Moskovakis.

IC:
 Oh yeah, yes, it's true.  He was already at UCLA.  He was a very young.
 
RW:
 Yeah, he was still an assistant professor and Church.  

IC: 0:22:37-0:22:40
 Oh, you had a lot of Church. Wow! Because he had just arrived.  It's true, he arrived in 67.

HK: 0:22:40-0:22:46
 Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  (Wow!)  And there was David Kaplan.

IC: 0:22:46-0:22:47
 You had David too?

HK: 0:22:47-0:23:04
 Yeah, he was not there and was replaced for the occasion.
 
IC:
 Sorry, sorry.  We were…

HK's wife:
 It's okay, okay.  Just finish your sentence.

HK:
 I shall finish my sentence and he will watch that I not start a new one.

IC: 0:23:04-0:23:12
 Okay. He was telling me all the wonderful people he had in his dissertation committee.  I mean he has half of the history of logic in his dissertation committee.

HK: 0:23:12-0:23:14
 It's actually…  

IC: 0:23:14-0:23:19
 I'm impressed. If you look at how much you can come in terms of tradition, in terms of minds.

HK: 0:23:19-0:23:24
 So the person who replaced him (incomprehnsible) was Howard Sobel?

IC: 0:23:24-0:23:35
 Oh yes, yes, because he was still, yes, because in 68, he left UCLA I think in 69.  Remember there was all that story about him not getting tenure, and Montague getting upset?

HK: 0:23:35-0:24:02
 because of that.  Yeah, I remember still writing a letter.

IC:
 Yeah, yeah, I found the letter, yeah. (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.)  I showed you the letter.
 
HK:
  Yeah, so that actually is connected with something that I also must tell you as part of…
