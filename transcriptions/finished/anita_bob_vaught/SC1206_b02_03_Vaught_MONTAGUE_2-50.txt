AF 0:00:00-0:00:01: Well, he's totally out of


RV 0:00:01-0:00:04: I'd like to know if anybody knows whether he's alive.


RV 0:00:04-0:00:06: He was in the worst part of earth.


AF 0:00:06-0:00:08: CC, where was he?


RV 0:00:08-0:00:10: Well, he lives somewhere near Saugus.


RV 0:00:11-0:00:15: I know that's what I remember there could be nearby, but I don't think it's any different.


RV 0:00:15-0:00:16: So it's a very dangerous place.


AF 0:00:18-0:00:23: But he had already sort of given all logic and all that up quite a while ago.


AF 0:00:24-0:00:24: Yeah, and …


RV 0:00:24-0:00:30: Yeah, but at that time he was kind of saying that he was going to come back up here.


AF 0:00:30-0:00:30: Oh, really?


RV 0:00:31-0:00:34: And present more on his paper about solving a problem of [ɪɹɪʃ??? ].


RV 0:00:35-0:00:36: You know what I'm talking about?


SF 0:00:36-0:00:37: No.


RV 0:00:38-0:00:40: Jean.


RV 0:00:41-0:00:46: This girl who's very good in practice except through


SF 0:00:46-0:00:48: ​Jean Rubin?


RV 0:00:48-0:00:50: No, no, no, very good.


RV 0:00:53-0:00:54: I can't think of any one.


RV 0:00:54-0:01:03: Anyway, it doesn't matter, but he was he told me that he would be up here the next spring and had a good conversation.


AF 0:01:04-0:01:10: Well, he got pretty heavily into some kind of substance, didn't he?


UNK 0:01:10-0:01:11: I think religion, religion.


AF 0:01:14-0:01:16: I think religion, but maybe also some drug.


AF 0:01:16-0:01:17: Maybe marijuana.


UNK 0:01:17-0:01:19: Could be nobody could be marijuana.


RV 0:01:19-0:01:20: But nobody ever said that.


AF 0:01:21-0:01:21: No.


RV 0:01:21-0:01:24: I think maybe when he was before he married.


AF 0:01:26-0:01:28: And now he got into some kind of zen


RV 0:01:28-0:01:30: And now he goes back to India every two or three years.


AF 0:01:30-0:01:32: Zen religion type of thing.


AF 0:01:32-0:01:32: Yeah.


UNK 0:01:34-0:01:36: I don't know whether they use marijuana or not.


UNK 0:01:37-0:01:38: Zen?


AF 0:01:38-0:01:39: I don't think so.


UNK 0:01:39-0:01:40: I don't think so either.


SF 0:01:46-0:01:47: Delicious.


AF 0:01:47-0:01:51: So, but Tarski never asked you to do any of his work.


RV 0:01:52-0:01:55: He never asked me, but he certainly didn't ask me a tenth …


RV 0:01:56-0:02:00: I was, I knew what he was giving Dana and Dick to do.


AF 0:02:00-0:02:00: Yeah.


RV 0:02:01-0:02:05: I think that I had been there so long he had to get rid of me.


AF 0:02:06-0:02:10: What about running errands or just sort of general gopher stuff?


RV 0:02:10-0:02:11: No, it wasn't


AF 0:02:11-0:02:12: No, nothing like that.


RV 0:02:12-0:02:14: Of course there's a way of dealing with that.


AF 0:02:15-0:02:15: Yeah, what was your way


RV 0:02:15-0:02:19: ​I don't know how I do it, but I do it.


AF 0:02:19-0:02:20: I see.


AF 0:02:20-0:02:21: You just you don't answer


RV 0:02:21-0:02:23: I don't know, something like that!


RV 0:02:23-0:02:26: I think it is true that some people get caught unnecessarily.


AF 0:02:26-0:02:26: Sure.


RV 0:02:27-0:02:27: You never say anything.


AF 0:02:28-0:02:28: Right.


RV 0:02:29-0:02:36: Dana, what Dana does is to.. Dana gets through it eventually because what Dana does is do say he'll do it.


RV 0:02:37-0:02:39: And then after a year and a half has gone by, it doesn't do it.


AF 0:02:39-0:02:39: Right.


AF 0:02:40-0:02:40: Yeah, yeah.


AF 0:02:40-0:02:43: Yeah, that's what it whereas you just don't say anything.


AF 0:02:43-0:02:44: You don't say it.


RV 0:02:44-0:02:48: I don't know what it is, but Montague wasn't too good at


AF 0:02:48-0:02:50: Wasn't too good at saying no.


AF 0:02:51-0:02:52: Right?


AF 0:02:52-0:02:54: Well, Sol certainly wasn't good at saying no.


AF 0:02:55-0:02:56: I don't know whether you got asked as much.


SF 0:02:56-0:02:57: I mean, I didn't run errands


RV 0:02:57-0:02:59: I don't think you were as bad as they were.


SF 0:02:59-0:03:00: Yeah.


RV 0:03:00-0:03:02: [Peter??? ] he picked on me the way he did on him.


SF 0:03:02-0:03:11: Tom Frain was the one who I felt was put upon to do a lot for Tarski.


UNK 0:03:11-0:03:15: I can see him just accepting it through his personality.


AF 0:03:17-0:03:19: Well, what about Steve?


AF 0:03:19-0:03:24: I mean, ​he wasn't his student, but Steve did everything for Tarski.


AF 0:03:24-0:03:24: And


UNK 0:03:24-0:03:26: I don't think Steve had to.


AF 0:03:26-0:03:26: No.


UNK 0:03:27-0:03:27: He didn't have to


AF 0:03:27-0:03:29: No, he didn't nobody had to.


AF 0:03:30-0:03:43: It's just that some people. Well, Leon Henkin felt that he was, you know, way, way, way taken advantage of and worked to death.


AF 0:03:43-0:03:51: He said he never dreamed of saying no, and that anything Tarski ever asked him to do was something he was always willing to do.


AF 0:03:52-0:03:54: You know, and I said …


RV 0:03:54-0:03:55: I'm totally lost.


AF 0:03:56-0:04:03: He was willing to do what Tarski asked him to do because it was Tarski.


AF 0:04:03-0:04:04: But he would


SF 0:04:04-0:04:06: Also he probably thought it was right.


AF 0:04:07-0:04:13: He himself would never have dreamed of asking people to do for him the things that Tarski asked him to do.


AF 0:04:13-0:04:18: And when I asked Jeanette, do you think Tarski overworked Leon?


AF 0:04:18-0:04:21: She said, Do I [GASP]?


AF 0:04:21-0:04:22: Of course he did!


AF 0:04:22-0:04:30: And Leon too was eventually getting some for different reasons, but was eventually getting some kind of ulcer symptoms or something.


AF 0:04:31-0:04:32: I mean, the man made up–that's terrible!


UNK 0:04:32-0:04:34: A lot of people, that people should get sick!


RV 0:04:35-0:04:38: That would be a lot different because this is when he's a


AF 0:04:38-0:04:39: Yeah, he's an eight


RV 0:04:39-0:04:39: –associate professor.


AF 0:04:40-0:04:40: Right, exactly.


UNK 0:04:41-0:04:41: That's terrible.


AF 0:04:43-0:04:46: You don't have to be I'm not putting judgments on all these things.


AF 0:04:46-0:04:47: I'm simply trying to


UNK 0:04:47-0:04:49: No I'm here with you.


AF 0:04:49-0:04:53: Elicit a picture, that's all and see who did what and why?


UNK 0:04:53-0:04:56: I know Steve was around him when he was a lot older and sick.


AF 0:04:57-0:04:59: I know and he was helping him


UNK 0:04:59-0:05:03: And he may have felt he wanted to, obviously, I think


AF 0:05:03-0:05:05: Leon wanted to too!


AF 0:05:06-0:05:20: Not that Leon didn't want to, but you just there are things you want to do and then you find yourself enmeshed and you do more, it turns out to be more than you bargained for.


UNK 0:05:20-0:05:20: Yeah.


RV 0:05:22-0:05:40: Leon is a much more … I don't know something that's simple ​but … a good administrator.


AF 0:05:40-0:05:41: Right


RV 0:05:41-0:05:46: An administrator and a good person who gets things done than anyone we mentioned.


AF 0:05:47-0:05:48: Right, yeah.


AF 0:05:49-0:05:49: Right.


RV 0:05:49-0:05:52: And it makes it a little harder to feel sorry for him.


RV 0:05:52-0:05:53: If he had all that ability


AF 0:05:53-0:05:55: I don't think he felt sorry for himself.


AF 0:05:55-0:05:56: I don't think he felt sorry.


RV 0:05:57-0:05:58: I never thought so I never thought he did.


AF 0:05:59-0:06:09: But he did a I mean he realizes that he did a tremendous amount of work for him perhaps in retrospect at expense of what kind of work he might have done on his own.


AF 0:06:09-0:06:18: I mean, Leon is somebody who said he never did work as good his thesis was the best piece of work he ever did and he never did anything better than that.


AF 0:06:18-0:06:21: Now maybe that was in the cards to begin with.


RV 0:06:22-0:06:26: That's about two mathematicians out of ten or five, yeah right?


RV 0:06:26-0:06:28: That's always said anyway.


AF 0:06:28-0:06:37: Yeah, but you're trying to make always put the best face on things and people don't always want to do that.


AF 0:06:38-0:06:40: In other words, you're trying to excuse everything.


RV 0:06:41-0:06:42: It isn't true anyway.


RV 0:06:42-0:06:50: I mean I have a hundred or fifty times read in print, said in print or said to Leon directly.


AF 0:06:50-0:06:50: Yeah.


RV 0:06:51-0:07:00: But some of his other papers such as the paper on Omega completeness were better than anything in his thesis.


AF 0:07:01-0:07:01: Yeah but anyways


RV 0:07:01-0:07:07: But he isn't saying that himself by that time he himself is under evaluating his paper.


AF 0:07:07-0:07:08: ​Right, exactly.


RV 0:07:09-0:07:19: Right and during that period probably four or five years after his thesis he was really doing very good work.


SF 0:07:23-0:07:31: If you do a really good thesis you're so impressed with that, the fact that you manage to do that it probably sits on your mind than


AF 0:07:31-0:07:33: I'm sure it does.


AF 0:07:34-0:07:36: I'll never be able to equal this


SF 0:07:36-0:07:46: then you're supposed to be a professional and you know you're supposed to be"just doing it" and probably the attitude is a little different.


SF 0:07:47-0:07:59: But I mean it's certainly true that a number of mathematicians do special thesis work and then don't ever go on to do


AF 0:07:59-0:08:00: Anything better


RV 0:08:00-0:08:00: Yeah.


AF 0:08:01-0:08:15: And it's hard to know what it is that, what are the factors you never know what the factors are in the first place that enable you to do, it's all kind of like magic anyhow! But …


SF 0:08:17-0:08:20: You were gonna ask Bob about what it took to get the thesis


AF 0:08:20-0:08:25: Right, I was getting there. So you go ahead and you ask some questions.


SF 0:08:27-0:08:30: So what was your experience?


SF 0:08:30-0:08:39: What did it take to do work that Tarski considered a thesis?


RV 0:08:43-0:08:48: I think that's difficult for all folks, what does it take to do work that I considered [UNINTELLIGBLE]?


RV 0:08:48-0:08:50: What does it take to do work that you consider otherwise?


RV 0:08:50-0:08:58: It's very complicated and you change and you feel bad about what happened with one so you're easier on the next one and so on and so forth.


RV 0:08:59-0:09:01: I'm not sure what you mean how to identify.


RV 0:09:02-0:09:02: What?


RV 0:09:03-0:09:05: He wanted you to do …


SF 0:09:05-0:09:14: Did you solve some problems and say, in your own mind, think that that ought to do for a thesis and Tarski


RV 0:09:14-0:09:29: Well when I solved the part of this problem that was in my thesis, ​some little problem, when I solved it I thought it was about the best thing I'd ever written.


SF 0:09:30-0:09:31: Which was that?


RV 0:09:32-0:09:33: The one that we [UNINTELLIGIBLE].


RV 0:09:38-0:09:40: He thought so too.


AF 0:09:40-0:09:44: So you didn't have to convince him that this was worthy.


AF 0:09:45-0:09:47: He recognized it right away.


RV 0:09:52-0:09:53: He was worried about my illness.


AF 0:09:54-0:09:54: Yeah.


RV 0:09:56-0:09:58: Maybe I'll get better job.


AF 0:09:58-0:09:59: Yeah.


AF 0:09:59-0:10:02: So it's pretty …


RV 0:10:02-0:10:22: And Kelly had actually gone to him I don't know how far back a year or two or three back and offered to put Kelly's in my joint paper together with things I'd already done with ​Tarski so I could get out.


AF 0:10:23-0:10:25: So I think you were


RV 0:10:25-0:10:29: And I didn't want to do it, I wanted to ​do something better than


AF 0:10:29-0:10:43: you were a unique case of somebody who I mean because it's Sol's impression that Tarski kept hanging on to people and wanting them to do more, more, more, whereas in your case he was saying"enough already!"


RV 0:10:43-0:10:45: No, I mean, he had been keeping me for years. I was there for years.


AF 0:10:45-0:10:54: Yeah but he really he proposed to you when Kelly came with his proposal


RV 0:10:55-0:10:58: Well he proposed to me that he would say he would agree accepted it didn't sound very hot about it.


AF 0:10:59-0:11:00: Yeah, but he would accept it.


AF 0:11:00-0:11:04: Whereas I think in no other case would he have accepted something like that.


AF 0:11:05-0:11:08: Well relate your experience for example


SF 0:11:14-0:11:45: Well he first had me working on cylindric algebra and the problem was the representation theorem for infinite dimensional cylindric algebras and after working on that for some time I came up with a proof which looked very much like the proof of completeness of predicate logic.


SF 0:11:47-0:12:16: And he wasn't satisfied with that because he felt that there ought to be a more algebraic proof but that was up till then I had thought in his mind that this was a significant problem that ought to be a part of the thesis if not the whole thing. At that point …


RV 0:12:17-0:12:25: This thing that had approved someone like this that's the thing you're talking about. The significant problem was this one.


SF 0:12:25-0:12:44: Yeah just that one I mean. I never cared for cylindric algebras so and I only did it because he assigned it to me as a problem.


SF 0:12:47-0:13:27: It was only after that that I started to come up well then he put me on the problem of decidability of the theory of ordinals under addition and I worked on that for a long time and got side results some of which fed into our joint paper and he didn't also my results about planite products, finite sums and products and preservation under equivalents again which I thought should be something that he ought to have been interested in.


SF 0:13:28-0:13:30: He never seemed to respond positively to that.


SF 0:13:34-0:13:36: All along when I do something


RV 0:13:36-0:13:52: Well that's a kind of a guaranteed thing. Ot's guaranteed to be an acceptable result, I'm not talking about the thesis, it's guaranteed to be an interesting result even though it's not very difficult in some ways very good result.


SF 0:13:52-0:14:05: Well but it's hard I was disappointed in his response and I don't know why he did respond in that way.


SF 0:14:06-0:15:02: In fact, you remember the Cornell Conference. We had done our work on generalized products together and I asked, we talked about what we might talk about at the conference, and I said"Well I would like to talk about this" and instead he wanted me to talk about the back-and-forth method of Fraïssé and ​Ehrenfeucht which wasn't my work. And so I never understood why he didn't take to this stuff that we had done, or that I had done anyhow, my part of it, on products when I thought … So you know that had nothing to do with my thesis and it ended up there was nothing in my thesis.


RV 0:15:02-0:15:04: It was all on Leon


SF 0:15:04-0:15:07: On arithmetization. Yeah. And that was part


SF 0:15:07-0:15:09: of Leon wasn't it?


SF 0:15:10-0:15:12: That was working with Leon while


AF 0:15:12-0:15:19: So was away in Europe then go on about that. Go on about the end.


SF 0:15:19-0:15:50: Well so then it was a question after I have done a number of things on that that I thought"these are really adding up to a thesis" and Leon was very encouraging, but it was a question of getting Tarski's approval. And Tarski kept hemming and hawing and hemming and hawing and so the question was well what would take him to give his approval because I was determined to finish.


SF 0:15:50-0:15:52: I wasn't going to at that point …


AF 0:15:52-0:15:59: As you remember by this time Sol had been away in the army and back and you know the thing is now stretching


RV 0:15:59-0:16:11: My feeling about what I could do and what I was capable of doing was just totally different. And you know I felt I'm ready to be born, is like the feeling, be out on my own.


SF 0:16:14-0:16:37: He said"Well we'll ​write Mostowski and ask his opinion of the work on arithmetization." And so I sent Mostowski the work and descriptions of the results and proofs and so on and Mostowski thought it was quite interesting and he said so, and he said he thought it was worthy of a thesis.


SF 0:16:37-0:16:59: Even then Tarski wasn't sure Yeah but so he let it go my feeling that it could have dragged on forever if I hadn't … maybe Leon talked to him too.


AF 0:16:59-0:17:04: Yeah, but I think this is not, I mean it's also Sol's case the way then I think it's not unique.


AF 0:17:04-0:17:06: I think there were other people who had the same thing.


AF 0:17:06-0:17:07: It was never enough.


AF 0:17:08-0:17:12: It was very difficult to satisfy him but I think your situation was really different.


RV 0:17:12-0:17:13: I don't see it that way.


AF 0:17:14-0:17:15: You think it was?


RV 0:17:15-0:17:16: In this context, no.


AF 0:17:16-0:17:20: So, you think it's the same, that it was very difficult to satisfy him.


RV 0:17:22-0:17:24: It's you that think that's bad. I think it may be good.


AF 0:17:24-0:17:27: No, I'm not saying it's bad or good. I'm just saying …


RV 0:17:27-0:17:47: I think of I think that certainly most professors in Berkeley at any rate let their students off way too easy and unless they're very good they'll have a pretty pitiful short slide because they haven't really had enough experience.


AF 0:17:48-0:17:48: Right.


AF 0:17:48-0:17:50: So how were you with your students?


AF 0:17:50-0:17:51: Were you as hard on your students?


RV 0:17:52-0:18:20: I remember one other thing you said that I bet applies to you but never said, listening to this story. About four years after, or three years after I got my PhD, Tarski said to me in some context that made it reasonable to be saying it was that he had a much better opinion of my thesis now than he had had four years ago.


RV 0:18:22-0:18:26: And that really had not changed Well I thought so there's nothing matter with that.


AF 0:18:27-0:18:28: No, no, but I think


RV 0:18:28-0:18:34: And I bet that's so he certainly acted very respectful to you all those years and I bet part of it wasn't, goes right back to the thesis.


RV 0:18:35-0:18:38: I mean don't you have that feeling with some of those students?


RV 0:18:38-0:18:40: Did you change your opinion as time goes on?


SF 0:18:40-0:18:43: Oh sure definitely.


AF 0:18:44-0:18:46: So how were you with your students?


AF 0:18:46-0:18:48: Were you very difficult?


AF 0:18:49-0:18:50: I mean did they think of you as difficult?


RV 0:18:51-0:19:02: Well in logic most people in Berkeley are, in logic their students take the longest of anybody in Berkeley.


AF 0:19:02-0:19:07: so and you're no different than any other person in logic.


AF 0:19:08-0:19:10: Well Henkin's students don't take forever do they?


RV 0:19:11-0:19:12: Henkin hasn't had but one student.


AF 0:19:13-0:19:14: Who was his student?


AF 0:19:14-0:19:15: Do you think?


RV 0:19:15-0:19:16: [Girl??? ]


AF 0:19:16-0:19:17: Huh?


AF 0:19:17-0:19:19: No who was Henkin's student?


AF 0:19:21-0:19:23: Somebody who worked with Tarski and then …


RV 0:19:23-0:19:26: Then finally got her degree in education with Henkin


AF 0:19:27-0:19:27: Ang did.


AF 0:19:28-0:19:29: Ang or his other student?


UNK 0:19:29-0:19:30: No, not Judy Ang?


RV 0:19:35-0:19:37: You may not even have heard of her because it's cheap.


AF 0:19:37-0:19:40: Somebody who went to SF State afterwards I think they did.


[crosstalk] 0:19:40-0:19:41: 


RV 0:19:42-0:19:43: I don't know where she was.


RV 0:19:43-0:19:44: No she's not there.


SF 0:19:44-0:19:45: What's her name?


[crosstalk] 0:19:45-0:19:47: 


SF 0:19:51-0:19:56: Henkin only had one student or only one who finished?


RV 0:19:58-0:20:09: Well he had very few students until ten years ago zero I think and then he may have had one in mathematics and one or two in education.


AF 0:20:10-0:20:14: So I guess anybody who thought they were going into logic thought they had to work with Tarski or something like that.


SF 0:20:14-0:20:15: That's amazing.


AF 0:20:15-0:20:16: Yeah.


RV 0:20:20-0:20:23: Well that was Leon, no that wasn't Tarski.


SF 0:20:23-0:20:24: No, no I understand.


AF 0:20:26-0:20:27: Whose student was


RV 0:20:27-0:20:30: I was always trying to sort of encourage Leon.


RV 0:20:31-0:20:33: Leon acts very self-compromising.


AF 0:20:34-0:20:34: Yeah.


RV 0:20:35-0:20:42: Usually you're in the position of asking him for advice or yeah I was always trying to encourage him just see how good his work was.


RV 0:20:43-0:20:58: Yeah he has to continue and work his other work, he's very good at this other work. And I think he received a fifty thousand dollars for all since Who was he?


RV 0:20:58-0:21:01: From some national …


UNK 0:21:01-0:21:04: He's traveling all over the world


AF 0:21:04-0:21:05: Yeah so yeah he's doing very well.


UNK 0:21:05-0:21:06: No, he's doing very well.


AF 0:21:06-0:21:17: Oh he's doing well but you know just in this what we're talking about now is doing he's doing something different than what we're talking about right at this moment.


AF 0:21:18-0:21:19: Whose student was Solovay?


AF 0:21:20-0:21:22: Bob Solovay.


SF 0:21:22-0:21:24: He was Mac Lane's student wasn't he?


AF 0:21:24-0:21:25: I see.


RV 0:21:26-0:21:30: No, I don't know about them no, I don't know you think so yes?


SF 0:21:30-0:21:32: Well ​it was in Chicago


SF 0:21:33-0:21:35: And you know who else was Mac Lane's student?


AF 0:21:35-0:21:35: Who?


SF 0:21:36-0:21:36: The road?


RV 0:21:37-0:21:38: Michael Morley?


SF 0:21:38-0:21:39: Michael Morley, right?


AF 0:21:39-0:21:39: Yeah.


AF 0:21:40-0:21:45: What you say that with a little twinkle in your eyes


UNK 0:21:47-0:21:51: I think because he got him to go back to into work again.


RV 0:21:52-0:21:54: I got on a plane somewhere.


RV 0:21:55-0:22:00: I went on the way to Poland and the only other person I knew on the plane no just by accident Mac Lane's on the plane.


RV 0:22:00-0:22:01: I don't think I'd ever met him.


RV 0:22:02-0:22:08: But he's a very nice guy and he recognized me and invited me to come and sit with him.


RV 0:22:09-0:22:30: And oh I don't know I was always trying to funny, since Morley had written most of the thesis with me and then came after that really started almost before he wrote too much he came and spent two years in Berkeley.


AF 0:22:32-0:22:33: Morley did.


RV 0:22:33-0:22:33: Morley did.


RV 0:22:34-0:22:36: It was a lot but I felt absolutely nothing bad about it.


RV 0:22:36-0:22:39: I liked the claim and he was very nice and what he did is absolutely right.


RV 0:22:40-0:22:48: That's another thing you can do as a graduate as a thesis of is take credit for someone else to a great extent.


RV 0:22:48-0:22:49: There's nothing the matter with it.


RV 0:22:50-0:23:04: If you start out in a certain way and get you must take credit for what's been done. I know he got he done, for one thing he got Morley to come back to school after ten years and you know there are all these things


AF 0:23:04-0:23:05: So Morley had worked with you


RV 0:23:05-0:23:12: Haven't you ever had a student who sort of drifted off to someone else but he's still sort of, you've done something for them.


RV 0:23:12-0:23:16: And it isn't too clear whether you should be one [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


AF 0:23:17-0:23:18: Why do you think-?


RV 0:23:18-0:23:35: He think had another big time with Mac Lane and that was when Yershov was here. When Yershov was here had a big fight on this campus then he went directly next to Chicago and Mac Lane wrote articles in the …


AF 0:23:37-0:23:38: Chicago newspaper?​


RV 0:23:38-0:23:40: No, the mathematical department didn't write articles-


SF 0:23:40-0:23:42: Notices, notices


RV 0:23:42-0:23:44: A long time after, Mac Lane was very strong


AF 0:23:45-0:23:52: But in what direction. She should have let ​him talk.


RV 0:23:53-0:23:57: Yes we should have just let him talk and well they will talk.


SF 0:23:57-0:24:09: Mac Lane was always very concerned to keep politics out of the Math society and this with this being one case.


AF 0:24:09-0:24:13: What was Tarski's position on that?


AF 0:24:15-0:24:16: Do you remember?


RV 0:24:17-0:24:23: Do I remember? I took him to see Tarski to see if the three of us together could work anything out.


AF 0:24:23-0:24:23: Yeah


RV 0:24:23-0:24:24: We didn't


AF 0:24:24-0:24:27: He didn't, so what was Tarski...?


RV 0:24:27-0:24:30: So Tarski was bitterly opposing his doing anything.


AF 0:24:31-0:24:35: Tarski was very much opposed to Yershov doing speaking


RV 0:24:35-0:24:42: Five years earlier both Tarski and I were in Moscow and Yershov did everything for us.


AF 0:24:43-0:24:43: Yeah.


RV 0:24:46-0:24:49: And Tarski didn't mind then that Yershov was anti-semitic.


AF 0:24:50-0:24:50: Well maybe …


RV 0:24:50-0:24:52: He is anti-semitic.


RV 0:24:52-0:24:53: Yeah, he did anti Similar.


RV 0:24:54-0:25:04: And I might not vote to bring him here to this country but once he was invited by the State Department. Did I see you then when I went I went down to Stanford again?


SF 0:25:05-0:25:06: No, I wasn't here at that time.


RV 0:25:06-0:25:09: And I went to Preizals and some other people came over.


RV 0:25:11-0:25:18: But Stanford was just seemed like a green compared to … and UCLA had no problem with it.


RV 0:25:19-0:25:35: [Oskovakos??? ] said that Yershov had been very hospitable to him and a Greek always returns hospitality.


AF 0:25:35-0:25:52: But I think there were some particularly egregious episodes that came to everyone's attention just before then whereas at the time that you were all being well treated in Moscow by Yershov, these were not well were not known or maybe even hadn't happened.


RV 0:25:52-0:26:00: Yes, CC's adviser was the most famous logician in Russia and the second most famous anti-semite.


AF 0:26:01-0:26:04: Yeah, who was the first, Yershov?


RV 0:26:04-0:26:06: He wasn't the first really, he was probably the tenth.


RV 0:26:06-0:26:09: Yeah, I thought his name was all those numbers here.


SF 0:26:09-0:26:10: Vinograta


RV 0:26:10-0:26:15: Vinograta was the next one. But I mean it can't be that Tarski


SF 0:26:15-0:26:17: But Maltsev-


RV 0:26:17-0:26:21: We Maltsev was at all these bars we went with Tarski and Maltsev would just say"hey old buddy."


RV 0:26:21-0:26:23: Well Tarski was a Catholic, you know, he wasn't a Jew.


SF 0:26:27-0:26:30: ​We should think of leaving in about ten minutes


UNK 0:26:30-0:26:32: Okay well I'll give you some fruit and you'll be on your way.


RV 0:26:33-0:26:34: Well I'm going to go with you.


AF 0:26:34-0:26:36: Oh you are, you're coming with us?


RV 0:26:36-0:26:37: I ​can't drive


AF 0:26:37-0:26:41: Ok, good. And then how will you get back?


AF 0:26:41-0:26:44: Will Marilyn, is Marilyn going to come down to dinner?


UNK 0:26:45-0:26:48: Oh okay are you we're going to go to dinner?


UNK 0:26:48-0:26:50: Are you going to go or having?


AF 0:26:50-0:26:54: Yes you are so Marilyn will come down or will Marilyn not go?


MM 0:26:54-0:26:55: I don't know whether I'm going or not


RV 0:26:55-0:26:58: She still hasn't decided.


AF 0:26:59-0:27:03: Well come on down, Marilyn!


MM 0:27:03-0:27:06: Well I'm thinking about it


RV 0:27:10-0:27:13: He already was here


AF 0:27:13-0:27:26: Right, yeah. I think it was making it probably making waves trying to make waves, trying to make an issue out of something like this so that it would be called to people's attention.


AF 0:27:26-0:27:32: I mean, I think it had probably less to do with Yershov than the issue of anti Semitism in the US


RV 0:27:32-0:27:34: Well they hated him.


AF 0:27:34-0:27:37: I'm sure they hated him too, but I think it, you know.


RV 0:27:37-0:27:38: It had a lot to do with him.


AF 0:27:38-0:27:46: It had a lot to do with him, but it probably had a lot to do with anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union at that time, which everybody wanted to talk about, I think.


RV 0:27:46-0:27:55: A couple of years ago I talked to this famous young student of Yershov


SF 0:27:57-0:27:59: Zilber?


RV 0:27:59-0:28:05: Yes, because it was clear that he was a very queer thinker.


AF 0:28:07-0:28:07: Was he a Jew?


RV 0:28:08-0:28:17: He was Jewish. And Yershov gave him a thesis so he did something positive ​[UNINTELLIGIBLE]


RV 0:28:17-0:28:20: Not from Zilber


AF 0:28:21-0:28:22: Well the one …


RV 0:28:22-0:28:28: He wasn't mad at me, I mean I mean figured I didn't know what I was doing.


AF 0:28:28-0:28:46: Yeah, well the one who was the worst that I ever heard about Yershov was this guy that I can't stand anyway butm and so I used to not credit in the old day, way back before everybody was talking about Yershov, I discounted what he said.


SF 0:28:46-0:28:47: Gorevich.


AF 0:28:47-0:28:48: Gorevich, because I just cannot stand-


RV 0:28:48-0:28:49: Gorevich?


AF+RV 0:28:49-0:28:50: Gorevich


RV 0:28:51-0:28:52: Oh, Gorevich!


AF 0:28:52-0:29:02: But I really can't stand ​him. But he attributed all his troubles in Russia to Yershov.


AF 0:29:02-0:29:12: Yershov got chosen for things that he didn't get chosen for and Yershov manipulated against him and all that, and it was all because he was a Jew and I thought he was using this as an excuse because he doesn't want to.


RV 0:29:12-0:29:13: Sounds like [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


AF 0:29:13-0:29:15: Well, maybe it does.


SF 0:29:15-0:29:17: But he was the first one we heard stories about Yershov.


AF 0:29:17-0:29:30: Right yeah and then, but as I say I was discounting it because of Gorevich, because of Gorevich being Gorevich but may, you know. It's not necessarily so, it may have all been true too.


AF 0:29:31-0:29:36: I still don't like Gorevich, but what he said may have been the case.


RV 0:29:40-0:29:52: I'm thinking out of two Israelis. Young maybe forty. one of them had cancer


AF 0:29:52-0:29:54: Now or did


RV 0:29:54-0:29:58: Three years ago when I saw him. You know who I'm talking about?


SF 0:29:58-0:30:01: No, but what about him?


RV 0:30:01-0:30:07: Well, simply that ​he had cancer and I'm sure, you know, I can just [UNINTELLIGIBLE].


AF 0:30:07-0:30:09: But are they related to Tarski in some way or just logic?


[crosstalk] 0:30:10-0:30:13: 


AF 0:30:15-0:30:16: You're not thinking of Shellach?


SF 0:30:16-0:30:19: Magidor?


RV 0:30:19-0:30:20: No, they're younger.


RV 0:30:21-0:30:23: And they're not as good as those [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


SF 0:30:23-0:30:24: Stavi?


AF 0:30:34-0:30:36: Beautiful fruit.


AF 0:30:45-0:30:48: Marilyn, we need spoons, I think.


MM 0:30:49-0:30:49: Pardon?


AF 0:30:49-0:30:51: We need spoons for our fruit


MM 0:30:51-0:30:52: Oh, absolutely!


MM 0:30:56-0:31:02: This is some clotted cream which I didn't get chance to beat


RV 0:31:11-0:31:13: When are you gonna retire, Solomon?


SF 0:31:15-0:31:19: Well right now never but …


AF 0:31:22-0:31:25: How long have you been retired?


RV 0:31:26-0:31:28: Two and a third years


UNK 0:31:28-0:31:29: Ninety-one.


AF 0:31:30-0:31:31: And do you teach at all?


RV 0:31:32-0:31:33: I can.


AF 0:31:33-0:31:35: Well sometimes you get called back


RV 0:31:35-0:31:51: Yeah but there are ten of us retired at the same time and none of us has ever been given any job. Well they told us to make us retire that we would get some half a semester, a semester the first year ​[UNINTELLIGIBLE].


AF 0:31:51-0:31:53: Are you sorry about that?


RV 0:31:54-0:31:56: I didn't care too much between the alternatives.


RV 0:31:57-0:32:00: I don't like to be cheated like that


MM 0:32:00-0:32:02: Yeah anyone like sugar, brown sugar?


AF 0:32:02-0:32:16: i just love it like this. So even though you haven't been called back to teach them you I know you don't care about I mean I know you're happy that you're retired That's correct, isn't it?


RV 0:32:17-0:32:21: I think about if I hadn't been able to stay on until I was seventy.


AF 0:32:21-0:32:22: You would have?


RV 0:32:23-0:32:27: Everything was more stable then. Here is a good place to get out of it.


[crosstalk] 0:32:27-0:32:29: 


RV 0:32:30-0:32:34: I sort of got that in advance. [UNINTELLIGBLE]


MM 0:32:36-0:32:38: You want some cream, Bob?


RV 0:32:50-0:32:58: They told us nobody else would be given this opportunity that we're getting this extra money we have, and they've had two more than


AF 0:32:58-0:33:00: Extra opportunities, yeah, right.


UNK 0:33:00-0:33:02: There's nobody left in the department any more?


AF 0:33:02-0:33:04: Everybody's retired, huh?


UNK 0:33:04-0:33:08: Yeah and they're only very young people.


AF 0:33:08-0:33:10: Is that true?


AF 0:33:11-0:33:13: Who's the oldest person in the department?


UNK 0:33:13-0:33:14: Addison?


AF 0:33:14-0:33:14: Is that right?


RV 0:33:14-0:33:17: You're talking about logic, no you're not talking about logic …


UNK 0:33:17-0:33:19: In logic. Whole department!


RV 0:33:19-0:33:21: Addison told me the other day that he and one other are the only people left.


AF 0:33:21-0:33:24: Only people left in logic or in the whole math-?


RV 0:33:24-0:33:26: In the whole department but the other isn't in logic.


AF 0:33:26-0:33:28: So like what's happened Smale did he retire?


RV 0:33:30-0:33:31: I don't know, Smale-


SF 0:33:31-0:33:38: The last time I was here for the Tarski lectures he was talking about possibly taking early retirement.


AF 0:33:38-0:33:40: And Mo Hirsch, did he retire?


RV 0:33:40-0:33:40: Wait a minute I-


UNK 0:33:41-0:33:41: Mo did, didn't he?


RV 0:33:42-0:33:43: I know more about Smale.


RV 0:33:44-0:33:56: Smale kept saying that he could retire even at age sixty or fifty five or whatever and make a big killing because he would get full salary wherever he went, probably Harvard.


AF 0:33:56-0:34:01: ​After, if he got a job yeah. But did he do it?


RV 0:34:01-0:34:05: Somebody told me he finally did apply a year or two ago.


AF 0:34:05-0:34:11: I mean that's what a lot of people have thought. They retire and then they'd go somewhere else and there's so many people


UNK 0:34:11-0:34:13: That's right, nobody's hiring anything anywhere!


[crosstalk] 0:34:13-0:34:15: 


AF 0:34:15-0:34:19: Well I mean there's a surplus of geniuses


RV 0:34:19-0:34:25: Hirsch retires either now or a month from now.


AF 0:34:25-0:34:27: Well how old are you, Bob?


AF 0:34:27-0:34:29: How old were you when you retired?


AF 0:34:29-0:34:30: Let's put that way.


RV 0:34:30-0:34:31: Sixty-five.


AF 0:34:31-0:34:42: You retired at sixty-five. And you didn't have to at that point, you could have stayed on till sixty eight is that it?


RV 0:34:42-0:34:43: Or possibly forever, it would have been-


AF 0:34:43-0:34:51: There wasn't, because at Stanford there was a line. At a certain point you had to retire. But past that, you know, past that you didn't …


[crosstalk] 0:34:51-0:34:53: 


RV 0:34:53-0:34:57: Nine people were up the same as I was …


AF 0:34:57-0:34:58: Retired.


RV 0:34:58-0:35:03: And they made that decision and they all retired, they were giving us a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


AF 0:35:05-0:35:10: Well do you know of anyone who's sorry they chose that route and wish they hadn't?


UNK 0:35:10-0:35:12: You mean in logic?


AF 0:35:13-0:35:13: Anybody!


RV 0:35:14-0:35:18: I mean everybody was sorry that they didn't do the opposite-


UNK 0:35:18-0:35:22: Thomas, Thomas was gonna teach for nothing! Wouldn't you say? Thomas?


RV 0:35:23-0:35:24: Who?


UNK 0:35:24-0:35:25: Emory Thomas?


RV 0:35:25-0:35:31: No, not Emory Thomas but there were some people that said that. It was Henry Helson


UNK 0:35:31-0:35:33: Oh Henry Helson


RV 0:35:33-0:35:38: Henry Helson is trying to get him to let him teach at seminar and nothing.


AF 0:35:38-0:35:40: So he really wanted to


RV 0:35:41-0:35:50: He ​wanted go to France to get an offer. France for a job for maybe a year or more.


AF 0:35:50-0:35:52: Uh huh. And what happened?


RV 0:35:54-0:35:57: And what's his wife's name?


UNK 0:35:58-0:35:59: Ravenna


RV 0:35:59-0:36:04: Ravenna said that she wouldn't go that she was just in her best position.


UNK 0:36:04-0:36:06: Best years!


RV 0:36:06-0:36:12: He's been kind of, well he's really perfectly happy.


UNK 0:36:14-0:36:19: What they have to learn to do is something else that's just as enjoyable.


[crosstalk] 0:36:19-0:36:22: 


AF 0:36:23-0:36:27: Yeah. Of course I mean I think what do you think?


AF 0:36:27-0:36:29: Do you think you'd miss the contact with students?


RV 0:36:30-0:36:36: You can do that in most universities you can do that as an emeritus. I mean you can't have a thesis student


AF 0:36:36-0:36:38: Yeah no I think that meant thesis student.


SF 0:36:38-0:36:43: I'm getting a little tired of teaching but I think I'd miss the teaching.


SF 0:36:44-0:36:48: I certainly miss advanced teaching and …


UNK 0:36:49-0:36:51: I hope-
