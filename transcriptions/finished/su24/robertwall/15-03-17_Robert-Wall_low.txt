RW: 0:00:30-2:51:47I'm not sure how much information I can  provide for you because...  You know, I...  I only met...
IC: 2:57:45-2:58:14
RW: 3:01:21-3:58:10 Montague. This is about, of course, about Montague.
IC: 3:39:19-3:45:30
SPEAKER_02: 3:39:19-3:45:30
IC: 3:45:30-3:45:47 you
RW: 4:02:23-5:07:55  I only met him once and that was that famous...
IC: 5:07:55-5:13:15Oh, you met him though?
RW: 5:13:15-7:18:08 Well, yes, at the church basement when we all had dinner. And I think maybe I sat next to him at lunch.
IC: 5:57:25-6:22:27 Yes!  Yeah!
RW: 7:22:38-9:09:30 We made small talk or something like that, but I think that was the only time I ever
IC: 8:04:49-9:21:53  you So do you remember him?
RW: 9:31:44-12:30:36 Vaguely, just vaguely. I knew who he was and I was aware of his work.  you know all of that uh actually
IC: 12:30:36-14:06:47Actually, well, do you mind? Can we start from that? Because that's a puzzle that interests me when I interview guys.
RW: 13:04:04-13:04:55Yeah!
IC: 14:12:42-20:28:44 to understand how you got to hear and know about his work. Could you briefly tell me about your background, where you were coming from intellectually, what kind of education you received, at which point you heard about Montague and his work. Just try to understand how people, especially in the final chapter, the one about the legacy,
RW: 18:42:25-19:04:55 Ah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: 20:29:51-20:37:44
IC: 20:33:30-24:42:42 It's like how it happens that you have a philosopher who works within philosophy and proposes something that  philosopher, just a few philosophers were affected by it, but other people in another field  were much more affected. So how did that happen?
RW: 24:35:23-25:48:14 Ah, well, let's see, how far back should we go in this?
IC: 24:44:40-25:50:29 That's fine 
RW: 25:50:29-25:50:45 you
IC: 25:50:45-25:55:49 I'm not.
RW: 25:55:49-26:01:10 AHHH
IC: 26:01:10-26:02:17 you
RW: 26:02:17-31:39:30 Ha ha ha ha  Well, uh...  My PhD is in chemistry, organic chemistry. But I got tired of that and decided that I wanted to do linguistics. Okay. It sounds like a perfectly normal thing to do, right?
IC: 28:35:00-33:18:14 Uh huh.  Okay? How did that- I'll do this.  I've learned from others that people can't... No, no, I'm into it actually. You did your PhD in the US.
RW: 33:18:14-33:19:21 Yeah.
IC: 33:19:21-33:19:38 you
RW: 33:19:38-33:57:53 I was in Harvard.
IC: 33:44:23-34:48:30 Okay, so you did your PhD in chemistry at Harvard. How did you hear about linguistics?
RW: 34:20:40-41:05:06 Happy  Well, I started going around auditing courses at Grace because I work in the lab, you know, working on my dissertation, you know, night and day and everything. And it gets boring after a while. And so I thought, well, here I am at this wonderful school. Why don't I go and sit in on some courses? And so I did. I sat in on
IC: 39:17:06-39:22:10 Alright.  you
RW: 41:11:34-45:43:15 I do sociology courses.  Then I hit up on the linguistics course, which was actually about Indo-European. I don't know, but this is really fascinating and everything. So I decided, well, I would just take a break from chemistry and I would try to investigate linguistics.
SPEAKER_02: 43:18:08-43:24:36 Mm-hmm.
IC: 43:24:36-43:33:19 Oh, yeah.
RW: 45:55:55-49:54:25 Well, it's a long story, but anyway...  I wound up sort of at the computation lab.  Ugh.  And I was  at Harvard, taking Linguistics courses and
IC: 48:50:34-48:57:36 Thank you.
RW: 50:05:40-51:47:12 I'm working on a machine translation project. We were trying to do Russian to English.
IC: 51:32:17-52:06:53 I wasn't addressing that project.
RW: 52:04:04-52:42:02 Who was the focus?
IC: 52:22:38-53:07:04 Who was involved in that process?
RW: 52:54:08-59:16:55 Well, it was Tony Ottinger, and we were working with very primitive equipment. I mean, you can imagine. This was in 1961 or so. And our IBM mainframe computer had 32K of memory.
IC: 53:41:40-55:49:04 You  you
SPEAKER_02: 55:49:04-57:46:04 This is the end of the video.  You are so beautiful.
IC: 57:46:04-57:52:49 Wow.
SPEAKER_02: 57:52:49-57:54:14 you
IC: 57:54:14-57:54:30 you
RW: 59:18:19-64:22:04 you  You really saw it all. I know, we were trying to translate Russian to English, right? Parsing the Russian sentences and then trying to translate them, you know, and so on. Well, it was quite a feat. But anyway, so I decided, well,
IC: 60:24:08-61:23:45 I can try.  I do that right.
SPEAKER_02: 61:23:45-61:38:06 you  you
IC: 61:38:06-61:39:47 you
SPEAKER_02: 61:39:47-61:40:04 you
IC: 61:40:04-61:49:38 But...
SPEAKER_02: 62:46:10-62:58:32 Get out of this way.
IC: 62:58:32-64:17:17 you  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-
RW: 64:26:00-69:55:38 This was fascinating. This is something I would like to continue to do. This is how I got into linguistics, but it was really in computational linguistics. I guess the Indo-European thing didn't really pan out. And then my first job was
SPEAKER_02: 67:26:51-67:35:34 I'm nervous.
RW: 70:02:57-70:22:38 at IBM.  you
SPEAKER_02: 70:22:38-70:27:08 you
RW: 70:27:08-71:10:10 in San Jose in the research lab.
SPEAKER_02: 70:51:36-70:51:53 you
IC: 70:51:53-71:20:00 Alex!  Ow!
RW: 71:29:00-79:09:42 where I continued this sort of thing. We were working on automatic indexing.  The idea was to take abstracts of scientific articles and by computer extract index terms and so on and so forth. Again, with very primitive equipment. I think the mainframe maybe had 64K of memory by that time.
IC: 74:57:59-77:02:17 you  And  you
SPEAKER_02: 77:02:17-77:06:14 you
IC: 77:06:14-79:26:51 you  Was it... Donald?
RW: 79:26:51-79:47:06 It was a bullseye.
IC: 79:28:15-79:50:12 With the multi-  you
RW: 79:56:23-82:29:23 But everything was batch processing and punch cards. I mean, really, really the dark ages of computation and so forth.
SPEAKER_02: 80:59:57-81:03:53 you
IC: 81:03:53-81:06:25 It's a good idea.
SPEAKER_02: 81:06:25-81:13:10 You know, I-
RW: 82:37:32-88:15:19 So I did that for a couple of years.  uh and uh  Then, I don't know, somehow I decided that I really needed to be in academia and not in industry. There were lots of up and downs with IBM at the time. They were not sure what we were supposed to be doing.
SPEAKER_02: 86:27:53-86:33:30 the
RW: 88:20:23-94:53:51 Should we work on sort of blue sky research or should we be working on applied things? You know the drill, right? So I decided I would look for an academic job and my first academic job was at Indiana University and I was really just hired over the telephone.
IC: 90:44:40-91:09:42 You know the drill.  you
SPEAKER_02: 91:09:42-91:18:08 Yeah.
RW: 95:21:59-97:14:12 Sounds so fussy. Jobs were so easy to get in those days, I know.
IC: 95:33:14-95:34:38 you
SPEAKER_02: 95:34:38-95:48:59 That's so funny.
IC: 95:48:59-95:49:32 you
SPEAKER_02: 95:49:32-95:50:40 you
IC: 95:50:40-96:23:34 Good job.  you
RW: 97:24:53-102:26:23 It was probably 1965 or something like that and so  They hired me and they said you can come and teach computational linguistics and mathematical linguistics and all of that stuff.
IC: 101:39:59-103:04:55 Ha!  So this was from the linguistics department?
RW: 102:58:10-103:43:10 Yeah, I was from the linguistics department in Indiana, right?
IC: 104:03:59-105:46:04 So was this for them a new area that they wanted to open or did they already have some?
RW: 105:29:12-112:19:49 you  They were trying to be up to date. I mean, they were aware of Chomsky and all that kind of stuff.  In fact, I guess they knew something about Chomsky's mathematical papers and they wanted  graduate students to be able to  you know, follow this. So they needed some courses.
IC: 112:19:49-116:22:49 So as far as your training about that, did you hear about Chomsky when you were at Harvard? Yes, I did. Also you did. So within the computational lab where you were working, you heard about him. Did you see him at that time?
RW: 113:29:17-119:11:34 Yes, I did.  At that time, you know, I can't remember. I think I may have...  gone to MIT and heard a couple of lectures. I mean, I certainly knew who he was.
IC: 118:36:59-123:51:59 Thank you  Because it was at the very beginning, Barbara told me that she, I think she's the first generation MIT student. She graduated in 1965, so she must have started in 1961, 1962 I think. And she said that she was the first one. So early 60s when the PhD program, the graduate program started.
RW: 120:36:47-120:41:17 you
SPEAKER_02: 121:56:40-121:56:57 you
RW: 121:56:57-130:11:23 You twice.  you  Thank you.  The graduate program started. Yes, a lot of places were starting linguistics programs at the time. And there was a kind of emphasis on mathematical and computational things and so forth.  So, um...  They.  They hired me for that and at that time I started working on the textbook which became Introduction to Mathematical Loomistics or whatever it was.
IC: 130:11:23-130:26:17 Oh.
RW: 130:20:23-132:11:45 Huh?  No, which eventually morphed into Parti, turbulent and wall.
IC: 132:05:00-134:30:42 So finally I can ask you if you are willing to join after Stanley just because I saw Stanley before you. Follow your name, transfer.
RW: 134:30:42-135:17:40 you  No, but I've already signed it.
IC: 135:24:42-135:35:57 You're deciding that now?
RW: 135:35:57-137:20:34 Yes! Remember the night at Lowry's.
IC: 135:56:45-138:51:08 You're right! You said it! You're right! You were there too! You're right! I will round you with all my montage guitar!
RW: 137:21:08-137:21:59 you
IC: 138:51:42-141:31:44 So this is the origin of this book.  So it started when you moved to Indiana for your first academic year.
RW: 141:31:44-145:33:53 I was in the first academic job. I knew then that if I were going to get tenure or rise in the academic ranks, I would have to have some kind of publication and so forth. So I started on this book.
IC: 141:32:51-142:05:12 I'm getting first.  Okay.
SPEAKER_02: 144:32:51-144:38:29 you
RW: 145:39:47-149:25:55 that  I didn't quite finish it, I guess, while I was there. But anyway, so I went to Indiana and...  there  where a bunch of graduate students, including Lowry Carton, had said,
SPEAKER_02: 149:25:55-150:52:15 That's a good start.
RW: 150:00:30-160:50:12 That's right.  you  you  E  And so that's when we became friends and I knew that he was very bright and destined for great things and so on. And so we talked to each other and then when I moved to Texas two years later, which would have been 67, I think Lowery moved there then or  Maybe it was a year later, I can't remember, but anyway, he also moved into Texas.  When I moved to Texas, I found Stanley Peters.
IC: 160:50:12-161:11:51 Ugh.
RW: 161:11:51-161:13:49 you
IC: 161:13:49-162:30:53 I know because he was already there.
RW: 161:23:06-167:52:38 I know, I know.  Yes, he was already there. He'd been there a year, something like that.  So I think that was when I managed to finish the book after that. But let's see, I'm trying to remember all this chronology. This was a long time ago. This was what, 40 some years ago or something, right?
IC: 167:23:06-172:48:14 We know that our memory is very selective, so we can remember things from the past very well and not remember what we had this morning. It sounds like a very exciting time. It was. I totally, because when I hear you guys talk about it, I'm so jealous. The birth of a feel, the excitement for being part of it.
RW: 168:41:17-173:09:53 well  you  you  Bye!  I know, I know, I know.
IC: 173:07:04-173:52:55 new air to discover, to explore.
RW: 173:43:21-185:18:19 Yeah.  And so, you know, I taught...  some introduction to mathematical linguistics and that sort of thing, and introduction to syntax and so on. And then I remember, taking him back to Montague, I remember when Lowry had come back from some conference where he had first heard of Montague and his work, and he brought this handout. And I remember he and Stan and I looked at it
SPEAKER_02: 176:06:47-181:06:02 you  Mm-hmm.  you  Mm-hmm.
IC: 181:51:02-181:51:19 you
SPEAKER_02: 181:51:19-182:00:19 Uh-huh.
IC: 185:18:19-186:46:04 Was this somebody trying to apply Montex?
RW: 185:18:36-190:07:27 you  of it.  No, it was a lecture by Montague. I don't remember what conference it was. I know, but it would have been in 1960.
IC: 187:07:27-188:40:32 Oh, I see. So, louder.  I can ask him, yeah, yeah.
RW: 190:27:25-193:32:29 Let's see, eight or nine or something like that. Okay. And we looked at this and we just, it just looked like incomprehensible gobbledygook to us. And we said, well,
IC: 191:07:04-191:28:10 Uh huh. Yeah.
RW: 193:36:08-194:16:21 We're not going to have to worry about this. I mean this is
IC: 194:15:30-195:57:53 you  Totally! So probably there must have been something about English as a Formal Language.
RW: 195:52:32-201:43:32 I think it was. I think it was. Yeah, now that I'm looking back on it. But I remember we just dismissed the whole idea. You know, this is so abstract and so complicated, it has nothing to do with linguistics whatsoever. And so, I mean, you know, so... But then of course...
IC: 197:48:59-197:53:29 That's for sure.
RW: 201:44:23-207:51:25 We began to get inklings from other places that maybe this was something we should pay attention to, you know. And I remember then at the time that Stan Stanley would, you know, look at this handout and maybe he got some information elsewhere and he would say, I think I figured out what this is about, right?
IC: 203:21:42-203:27:36 Thanks.
RW: 208:12:14-214:34:44 And then he would tell us, you know, I think what he's doing here is, so forth and so forth. Hmm, I see, that could be interesting. Well, maybe so, I don't know. Who is this guy anyway?  philosopher at UCLA and...  And so that's my first exposure to Montague.
IC: 214:34:44-220:20:23 So there was something like, if I understand correctly, it was like via Lowry first and then Stanley and the groups that you guys built there and brainstorming together. So the first reaction was like, what is this? It's very interesting. Then it's like, okay, you make an effort to go into it and start saying, well, maybe there is something.
RW: 216:15:25-222:06:25 Mmm.  Yeah.  to the front.  What is this?  Maybe there is something here, right? And then of course I'm sure that, you know, some of us were in contact with Barbara and...
IC: 220:34:44-220:44:17 Right.
RW: 222:12:36-227:34:55 many other people and so forth who said, oh yeah, really you should pay attention to this, it's quite interesting and you know, I know it's hard to fathom but you know, really, no, no, no. So of course we did and we took it kind of as a challenge that you know, we should try to make sense out of this. And
IC: 222:30:02-222:36:30 And so.
SPEAKER_02: 222:36:30-222:36:47 you
RW: 227:42:47-229:11:06 What year was the famous meeting in the church basement?
IC: 229:06:02-230:16:04 I believe it was 1969.
RW: 230:16:04-230:46:10 69
IC: 230:26:45-231:07:49 I need to double check that I...
RW: 230:58:15-234:45:30 But that sounds about right. And by that time...  I think, you know, we had come around to the idea that this was something we really should.  pay attention to and really needed to learn about it and so on.
IC: 234:59:00-239:39:08 Actually let me correct, I think it was the first half of 1970, I believe. I think it was definitely was not in the fall, it was something, I need to see, I have the program of the conference.
RW: 236:32:23-240:03:36 Maybe something.  And you wish we had the broke.  It's about that time, yeah.
IC: 239:45:53-242:38:17 Yeah.  Because he presented universal grammar. So what he talked, which is around that time when he...
RW: 240:35:40-243:17:57 Because he doesn't  So what are you...  Yes, work it out.
IC: 242:42:30-242:47:34 Yeah.  you
RW: 243:30:53-245:34:38 Then I'll see I'm a little fuzzy on...  the chronology of things. But I guess after that  you
IC: 245:34:38-245:36:19 So
RW: 245:36:19-245:58:32 So, Bob, can I ask you again?
IC: 245:39:59-251:13:15 Bob, can I ask you, because you said that you were at that event. I was there. That means that your group there, Austin, was in touch with UCLA. Yes. I guess by Barber. Probably Barber. By Barber. So at that time, who was there, Austin? It was you, it was Lowry, it was Stanley, was David there?
RW: 246:23:17-252:55:21 I was, I was there.  Yeah!  Probably by Barbara.  remember. He probably was, but I can't be sure.
IC: 252:55:55-253:32:29 But you guys were not working on the textbook yet.  you
RW: 253:32:12-253:56:23 Not yet. Not yet. Okay.
IC: 253:40:38-254:14:23 No doubt, okay, so that comes later.
RW: 254:13:32-255:19:55 That comes later.
IC: 254:27:36-254:41:57 you  Yeah.
RW: 255:31:27-259:03:30 Well, of course, the way the book started was that...  Ugh.  David prepared a bunch of notes because he decided that he was going to give a course at Ohio State.  on this stuff.
SPEAKER_02: 258:42:59-258:45:47 and
RW: 259:08:51-264:56:29 And, um...  I think.  that I think it was Stanley first who  put together a course or maybe introduced it sort of into the semantics course or something at Texas. And then I also
IC: 262:36:59-263:25:04 Yeah.  you  Man.
SPEAKER_02: 264:03:36-264:12:19 Shh.
IC: 264:28:55-264:31:27 you
RW: 265:15:02-269:10:44 taught part of this in a course somewhere or something.  Alright.  I don't know. But anyway, it was all kind of very fluid. And we decided, well, the students need to know about this, whatever it is, that we're going to try to
IC: 268:33:36-268:41:12 Smith here.
RW: 269:22:32-270:49:10 introduce them to the idea that they should have a look at.
IC: 270:50:51-280:18:59 Bob, was there a time, because I don't know about this and unfortunately, I mean I don't have direct information, but from the direct information that I collected David is not doing well, so I cannot interview him. So was there a time when David was at Texas? Yes, yes. Because his webpage doesn't have a CV, doesn't have anything, so I really don't know, but I seem to remember that there was a time when he was at Texas. Oh yes, it was, yes, of course.  Because I believe that this is later in the years, but...
SPEAKER_02: 278:44:29-278:49:49 Because
IC: 280:41:29-280:42:36 you
RW: 281:01:10-283:06:02 No, of course he was. Yes, he was one of our graduate students. Exactly. And I'm sure I was on his dissertation committee.
IC: 282:09:14-282:10:21 you
SPEAKER_02: 282:40:27-282:44:06 you  you
RW: 283:21:30-283:31:04 That's what I...
IC: 283:31:04-283:32:12 you
RW: 283:32:12-283:32:45 you
IC: 283:32:45-285:51:59 Okay, yeah  This is all the direct information that I collect.  Oh, I don't know why not. Bless you.
RW: 285:42:25-287:37:10 bless you I know it's something coming from that I know no that's of course that's right I mean
IC: 286:07:10-288:09:47 There must be something coming from the inside.  But his webpage doesn't have much information and so he...
RW: 288:06:42-297:35:06 Yeah, I'm sure that David was exposed to this in one of our courses. Okay, good. So, yeah, because that's what I thought. And then when he went to our estate, he decided that he needed to expand on this and give a course on how to use semantics. That's when he prepared the notes. Okay. And then we all got copies of the notes, and that's when Stanley said, well, you know, what we should do is we should take his notes
IC: 289:38:40-291:06:08 Okay good. So yeah, because that's what I thought. That's what he paid. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: 293:28:27-297:42:25 Okay.  Huh?  you
RW: 297:42:25-302:31:32 you  And so I said, okay, well let's do that, you know, so okay. And that's how this thing started. And of course there were lots of delays and ups and downs and so forth. We were waiting for Stanley to do his part and it was slow and we were in the
IC: 302:30:08-305:59:40 Would you say that the book was officially published in 1981? Would you say that the idea started way earlier, like almost right after Montague's death?
RW: 304:15:53-306:43:15 81. 81, yeah.  you  Well, his death was in what year?
IC: 306:26:06-307:43:44 Which was what year? 1971. March 7th, 1971.
RW: 306:45:14-316:12:30 you  Thank you.  March  71.  It was...  I'm trying to fit it in with the chronology of where I was at those times because I took a year off, went to Denmark in 71 and then also again in 75, 76 and I know that we were working on it then.
SPEAKER_02: 312:39:36-312:49:27 Uh huh.
IC: 315:37:55-325:13:21 So in the mid-70s you were already working on it. In the mid-70s we were already working on it. Which also made sense that there was also the book, Thomason's collection, that came out in 1974. There was also an issue of circulation. The proper treatment of quantification in ordinary English came out in 1973 in the proceedings, and then in 1974, I'm sure that the manuscript was circulating,
RW: 316:16:44-318:54:30 you already worked in the mid 70s we were already working on it you know  Right.
SPEAKER_02: 319:33:36-319:51:19 Right.
RW: 319:51:19-319:51:36 you
SPEAKER_02: 319:51:36-320:03:25 of
RW: 324:50:34-330:28:04 That's true, yeah. And of course we were all in contact with each other. I remember, you know, Rich Thomas being at a conference in Texas.  In the meantime, I guess on my second trip to Denmark, that's when...  That's when we started Linguistics and Philosophy.  So I became the editor.
IC: 330:11:12-330:37:38 Oh you wanna talk to me then?
RW: 330:32:00-331:18:59 Was the first editor because I saw your name
IC: 331:03:47-331:36:25 Because I saw your name, yeah.
RW: 331:31:55-331:49:55 Right, okay.
IC: 331:45:08-333:17:06 Wow! Can you briefly tell me who came up with the idea?
RW: 333:12:19-339:46:04 Well, it was the Kluwer Publishing Company, and they had been publishing Foundations of Language. Yes, yes, yes. And they had had some feud or something with the editorial board of Foundations of Language. I don't know what it was all about. But anyway, they decided they know they're going to publish this.
IC: 334:01:15-334:17:34 Uh huh, uh huh.
SPEAKER_02: 335:44:12-336:06:08 Yes, yes, yes.
IC: 336:06:08-338:31:32 And...  about.
SPEAKER_02: 338:31:32-338:39:59 I see.
RW: 339:59:34-349:42:02 And they said, well, we'd like to have a journal in formal linguistics and semantics and this sort of thing. And they wanted to call it, they wanted to continue it as Foundations of Language and then there was kind of a lawsuit about who has right to the title Foundations of Language. Anyway, it was decided finally that
SPEAKER_02: 344:49:32-344:53:12 I
IC: 345:01:04-345:01:38 you
SPEAKER_02: 349:06:36-349:14:29 She's a genius.
RW: 349:45:59-361:13:21 Ugh.  That was how it happened, right? Linguistics and philosophy. I think Stanley Peters came up with the name. And we wrote this sort of message to contributors what we were going to be about and all that sort of thing. And then we started. But the idea was also in our minds that we would be able to publish papers in Monika's semantics because we weren't afraid of the formalism and all of that kind of stuff.
SPEAKER_02: 351:30:36-351:36:47 I think
IC: 351:36:47-351:37:21 you
SPEAKER_02: 352:02:57-352:12:47 it.
IC: 352:12:47-364:37:49 That's right.  Let's walk.  Six... seven... seven...  Yeah, I'm sure because I'm sure because Lowry's paper was on the first volume. It's the first paper, the first volume. Exactly. I know that for sure. Right, okay.
RW: 362:14:40-363:52:15 Right.  Right. It's the first paper, the first of all. Exactly.
SPEAKER_02: 363:52:15-363:52:49 you
RW: 364:18:42-367:26:00 Right, okay, and on the editorial board of course was Rich Thomas and then and Barbara and you know you know all the usual suspects
SPEAKER_02: 364:37:49-367:27:25 I  I'm not sure.  you
RW: 367:27:25-380:35:29 Hmm.  So that was  But at the same time, I know that we decided that we needed to work on this textbook of  It dragged on for quite some time, I guess, because other things kept getting in the way.  you  I don't know.  David got very heated about it saying, well, are you guys going to finish or not? And if not, I'm going to publish it myself. It was my notes. All that. And I said, well, you know, I think I've done my part, but you know, Stanley still hasn't done his part. So actually, as a kind of desperation measure,
SPEAKER_02: 376:12:47-376:51:36 I'm wrong. It was my note.
RW: 380:47:17-382:22:55 uh, Stanley and I decided that we were going to  hole up in a hotel room.
SPEAKER_02: 382:50:45-383:04:49 Until...
RW: 383:42:30-384:21:19 and not come out until it was finished.
SPEAKER_02: 384:06:42-384:23:17 you  movie.  you
RW: 384:23:17-384:25:15 you
SPEAKER_02: 384:25:15-384:47:29 Oh yeah.
RW: 384:28:38-384:36:30 Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 385:34:27-386:44:45 Hahahaha  I'm sorry.
RW: 386:44:45-387:54:30 So we checked into a hotel, we did, we checked into a hotel in Austin.
IC: 387:59:00-388:56:23 Oh really? Like this is a movie? Tell me in Texas.
RW: 389:59:23-395:05:06 And of course Stanley still didn't finish. I mean it was, you know, he would write for a little bit and then he would say, what about this? You know, should we say something about this? I said, Stanley just write it down. You know, it can all get edited later. Just write it down. Well I was thinking, you know,
IC: 392:02:17-392:03:08 you
SPEAKER_02: 392:03:08-392:04:49 you
IC: 392:04:49-392:09:02 you
SPEAKER_02: 394:54:25-395:11:00 You know what's happening.
RW: 395:54:02-398:21:25 And so, I don't know, I think finally there was like an ultimatum from
SPEAKER_02: 397:39:47-397:47:40 From
RW: 398:34:21-409:34:27 Phew.  David that said, look, if it's not done by X, I'm gonna publish what I have and you guys can just, you know. So that galvanized Stanley into actually submitting. Actually, I think it was already in page proofs when Stanley was writing his final chapter on universal grammar and sending it off to the Netherlands.
IC: 405:10:55-405:50:00 Thank you.  you
SPEAKER_02: 405:50:00-405:55:38 Thank you.
IC: 405:55:38-405:56:45 you
RW: 409:41:29-410:21:59 talking with each other.
IC: 410:04:32-420:09:47 Well, I never had the chance to talk. I mean, as a graduate student, I saw David at conferences, but I never talked to him. So I never had the...  the opportunity, the possibility of interacting with him. And so, I don't know, like, I heard from people that knew him that, you know, he had a complicated nature. Yes, yes. So not easy to handle. So I can imagine, especially in these kind of circumstances, when you're dealing with somebody who has a very different nature, both in terms of timing and how to get things done. Yes, exactly. I feel that it was not easy for you to be like, you know,
RW: 414:58:10-422:41:57 Go ahead.  Yeah.  Yes. So not.  Yes.  It was after this I said I'll never be a co-author on a book again but then Partee, Turbulent and Walt started so...
IC: 420:14:51-420:19:55 It was
RW: 422:43:55-423:28:04 you  Exactly. Here we are.
IC: 423:28:04-425:51:14 Look where I got this was in 1984 at my first blog conference in Vienna. That's why I bought
RW: 425:51:14-426:25:15 Really? Oh my God.
IC: 426:25:15-426:46:21 Oh my goodness
RW: 426:25:32-426:46:38 Oh my goodness.
IC: 426:46:38-426:51:25 Okay.
RW: 426:51:25-426:52:49 you
IC: 426:52:49-426:56:12 you
RW: 426:56:12-426:57:02 you
IC: 426:57:02-426:57:19 you
RW: 426:57:19-427:02:06 Would you like to see more of our videos?
IC: 427:02:06-427:02:23 you
RW: 427:02:23-427:05:29 What?
IC: 427:05:29-428:01:44 Yes, yes, I love that.
RW: 427:05:45-428:19:10 Yes, yes, I love that.  Ha ha ha!
IC: 428:19:10-436:14:12 Actually, sorry, let me give you, I just realized that I gave you a pencil. Oh, here, I have a pen. I have a pen here. This looks like a pencil, but it's actually a pen. Yes, I still remember that conference, and that's when I was still an undergraduate, and I was in philosophy of language. Nobody was teaching these things, but I heard about them, and so when I go to this conference, I see the book just came out, this edition for students,
RW: 428:36:36-436:19:49 Ugh!  Oh, right here. I have a pen. I have a pen.  Yeah.
IC: 436:17:17-447:43:49 And then my library didn't have it and I said this looks like it. Because I was trying to go through these papers and I got this.  Yes, so this was around the same time, but a few months later. In fact, you see, this was in April 8th. Well, this is November 11th. Because I think from this I said, oh, there is this, such a book, so let me go and get it. So I ordered this book. Because remember, we are in Italy, so just to get these books in 1994 before the internet, it was a problem. You have to go to one of the specialized bookstores that was able to order books from abroad. I know, I know. They were very expensive, so I had to work hard.
SPEAKER_02: 439:43:27-439:52:10 Thank you.
RW: 439:52:10-442:02:06 you  Well, please  Ah!
SPEAKER_02: 443:32:06-443:44:45 Ahhh
RW: 446:24:14-453:03:02 I know, I know.  That was part of our dilemma with all of this, is that the things were priced so high. The same thing was true of the journal Linguistics and Philosophy, where we're constantly saying, why do you price? Well, because it's so expensive, and the press room is so small, and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.
IC: 453:03:02-453:03:19 you
RW: 453:03:19-453:03:53 you
IC: 453:03:53-470:30:08 So by the way, you really had quite a group of very smart students at the beginning of your career to start like that. That's fantastic. Oh yes, yes, yes. I know. So can I ask you, stepping back to that conference where you guys went, like the UCLA conference, this was the first time that you saw Montague presenting his work and you also saw him debating with other people.
RW: 453:09:30-453:12:53 you
SPEAKER_02: 462:45:47-462:49:10 Would you-
RW: 469:42:53-478:53:17 I'm sorry.  capacity.  That's an interesting question. The first I can answer, I don't remember his presentation particularly. I'm sure I was there and I'm sure I was looking at the handout, but I don't remember it at all. It's completely gone from my memory. But why, was this fascinating enough to work on? I guess it's probably the same sort of motivation that I had from trying to figure out Chomsky's mathematical stuff.
SPEAKER_02: 478:53:00-479:00:36 Mm.
RW: 479:00:36-484:52:27 I decided, well, I have a certain ability to understand mathematics and so forth, so I can make sense out of this if I just try hard enough. I would go through Chomsky's papers and Chomsky, Schutzenberger and all this sort of stuff and try to figure it all out. Then when this came along, which was totally new,
IC: 483:21:36-483:24:08 you
SPEAKER_02: 483:24:08-483:27:14 you
IC: 483:27:14-483:29:12 you
SPEAKER_02: 484:16:27-484:16:44 you
RW: 484:58:55-489:12:19 I guess it was the same sort of challenge. I said, well...  I'm sure I can figure this out if I really try hard enough. And so, over time, it gradually gets clearer. And there's a certain sense of accomplishment when you feel like you're...
IC: 489:03:02-489:17:06 It does.  satisfaction.
RW: 489:17:06-496:16:44 That's right, yeah, that's why you've really achieved something. So it was the same sort of challenge, I think. And I wasn't sure whether Chomsky's work was ever really all that relevant to linguistics. I mean, of course, all the stuff about the context for grammars and regular grammars and all that kind of stuff, well, it's interesting, but, you know,
IC: 489:17:57-489:37:21 That's right, yeah.
RW: 496:17:34-502:56:57 Does it really affect what linguists do day to day and so forth? Well, I mean, not so much. And this, I had the same sort of feeling. Well, I think there's something here and it may be relevant to linguistics, but I want to know it anyway, whether it's...  directly relevant to what linguists do or not.  I think why I decided to do it. It's just the intellectual challenge.
IC: 502:58:21-510:03:02 I don't get it.  When did you decide that it was worth teaching these things? Because one could say, look, I'm intrigued, I'm curious, I want to understand it, but I don't think it's worth teaching it. But then there is also an extra step, which is a step of saying, well, I want to teach these things, I want my students to understand these things as well. Which is a, I mean, the two things, I can see how they can be related, but it doesn't fault, one doesn't necessarily, I mean, the first doesn't necessarily trigger the second.
SPEAKER_02: 508:10:49-508:11:23 you
RW: 508:11:23-520:22:21 Yes, she is.  That's true, that's true. Well, I think it was just a combination of...  Stanley.  uh...  sort of doping it out saying, oh yeah, I can see what he's getting at here. And Barbara, who said, look, you really need to pay attention to this, I think there's something important here. And people like Rich Thomas and so forth were saying the same thing, and so all of that, these are people we trusted and whose intellects we admired, and so we said, well, all right, we should pay attention to this then, all right, that's good enough for us.
SPEAKER_02: 513:46:38-517:44:00 Mm-hmm.  you  Yeah.
IC: 517:44:00-522:49:10 you  So you were interacting with Thomas on around the time he was like editing the book or when he was done with the book? Yeah. The mid-70s? Yeah, yeah.
RW: 521:23:57-529:00:42 Yeah.  Yeah. The mid-seventies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he was on the, well he was on the, not only the editorial board, but the executive committee of linguistics and philosophy. So, you know, we were in constant contact about, you know, things and so on. And we would see each other at conferences and so on. And, you know, it just kind of reinforced this idea that, you know, this is something
IC: 524:45:53-525:38:29 philosophy.
RW: 529:06:02-530:13:49 That's important. We need to know it.
SPEAKER_02: 529:26:17-529:27:42 you
RW: 530:17:29-531:23:00 you know, uh, tense.  Um...  That was it.
IC: 531:09:30-533:56:17 So, can I ask you, around that time, the time when you get to know Montague's work and you get interested into it, is also the time of generative semantics.
RW: 531:42:42-534:04:27 Bye!  Yes.
IC: 534:04:27-540:15:08 you  Um...  So  What was your exposure to that and because it sounds like you got much more intrigued by this approach to the study of language than what was happening on the other side. Can I ask you why?
RW: 537:49:44-537:54:47 Yeah.
IC: 540:16:32-550:32:29 you  No, because those were like linguists. Here we have somebody who is not a linguist, superficially knows, although probably he knew with his emergence that he knew about languages more than we thought, given at least the knowledge that he had of this variety of languages, and he had taken advanced language classes where probably grammar was presented in a certain way, but you know, that's going to be... But he clearly was not a linguist and he didn't want to be a linguist.
RW: 541:26:00-542:36:36 Yes.  Yeah, it's a floss.
SPEAKER_02: 543:57:19-544:02:23 More time.
RW: 544:02:23-544:35:51 you  you
SPEAKER_02: 544:35:51-544:37:49 Yeah.
RW: 544:37:49-544:38:40 you
SPEAKER_02: 544:38:40-544:39:30 you
RW: 544:39:30-545:03:25 you  Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 546:41:17-548:24:47 you  Sure.  Yeah.
RW: 548:24:47-553:00:42 you  Well, let me tell you also that when I was in Indiana, I happened to be on George Lakoff's dissertation committee.
IC: 550:53:51-553:19:32 Let me tell you all  you  No way.
RW: 553:19:32-553:35:00 No way.
IC: 553:35:00-553:36:25 you
RW: 553:48:30-567:30:53 But why you got them all? I got them all.  Quite by accident.  I've never met the man.  Somebody collared me in the hall and said, we have a defensive dissertation down the hall and we need one more person, so can you come and sit in, right? And so there was George Lakoff defending his dissertation, which he wrote under the supervision of Fred Householder. And I thought, what is this? This is the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my life.  So you saw the nerd. I saw the nerd. And I got to know Hedge Ross fairly well and Jim McCauley and all of those people. Okay, so you knew them. Yeah, I did.
IC: 565:59:29-568:55:32 you  Ok, so you knew them. It was not just an initial like, we are distant apart. No. So you were familiar with them.
RW: 568:11:06-570:00:14 No, no, no. I mean, we went to the same parties and all that.
IC: 569:27:53-569:34:55 Uh huh.
RW: 570:05:51-593:14:06 I was never really satisfied with what was going on in that period.  It just seemed to me  So loose and  Oh.  So...  untestable. I mean, it was, yeah, it just, you know, it did not satisfy my feeling that this is the way a science should operate. You should make testable hypotheses and you could be able to find out whether something was right or wrong, depending on the predictions it made and so forth. And that was my ultimate reaction to generative semantics. I said, but  How can you falsify it? How can anything ever be wrong in generative semantics? Like the thing you were talking about the other day when I guess at Barbara's talk when George said that adjectives come from sentences, right?  Well...  you  you  you  Show me how that's falsified.  So I never took it all that seriously, you know. Although...  Yeah.  It was...  It was obviously a movement and something we had to pay attention to, but I don't think...
IC: 592:08:51-592:15:19 You know, you're saying
RW: 593:21:25-627:27:30 A lot of us ever really took it seriously. It was just kind of... I remember...  a paper  Buy them!  Hedge Ross arguing for...  something about it, I can't remember what it was, but some sort of generative semantics thing.  and he gave  13 arguments in favor of some particular derivation or something.  And I told Hadj, I said, you know, I refer to your paper as the 13 sieves argument. If you stack 13 sieves, you think it will hold water.  Ew.  That's a good metaphor. And Hatch actually liked that. He referred, took his paper as the 13 sieves paper rather than the 13 sieves paper.  So that was my attitude toward all of that. I said, okay, you know, nice work guys, but you know  To be honest with you, that was my difficulty with linguistics generally. You can push it here and it pops out there, and you can push it there and it pops out here, and you can never know anything for sure.  You know, I mean, well, some things may, but I mean, it was just like all this theory and speculation and so forth just...  It was totally unsatisfying. I used to say, look, if someone asked you at a cocktail party,  Uh, results.  have you gotten out of the last 25 years of linguistics for sure that you can say this is  Definite. This is what we know now about.  natural language.  You'd be very hard-pressed.  to explain to somebody.  What we know for sure is absolutely an incontrovertible fact.  No.  Except for, you know, just observations. Sure.
SPEAKER_02: 627:14:17-627:22:27 Sure.
RW: 627:28:38-630:05:00 Yeah, and so, you know, it has this character. I mean, you know, that it's kind of open-ended and squishy. Don't you think about it?
IC: 629:48:42-644:50:40 Don't you think I mean you think this is much different from other sciences this study High-level human behavior. I mean it's not the psychologists doing much better from my little knowledge if anything My impressions that the field is very much going into this hyper Emphasis towards experiments, so you need to have a new experiment that has not been done before perfectly Done according to all the criteria the perfect statistical analysis, so you know all the fancy tools
RW: 635:20:00-635:24:30 Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 639:24:59-639:29:29 Yeah.
RW: 642:11:29-642:13:44 you
SPEAKER_02: 642:13:44-642:20:45 What do you say?
RW: 642:20:45-642:21:19 you
SPEAKER_02: 644:50:40-645:00:14 you
IC: 644:55:10-645:28:04 What's your theory of concept formation?
SPEAKER_02: 645:28:04-645:36:14 Amen.
IC: 645:36:14-657:29:29 you  There used to be a time when psychologists were looking at theories around them, like they were doing this for language. Oh, like, okay, generative grammar, that's a theory of language. Our experiment shows that this is true or shows that this is false. Now, usually that was done in a clumsy way, but at least there was a desire of contributing to a more general theory. And more generally, it sounds to me like, let's not even talk about sociology and so on. So it sounds like there is a kind of
SPEAKER_02: 650:56:51-651:10:04 Yeah.
RW: 657:27:30-657:30:36 you  you
IC: 657:30:36-657:50:34 And I wonder if...
RW: 657:33:42-657:34:15 you
IC: 657:52:32-658:10:32 Well, that numbers
RW: 657:54:14-670:30:14 Well, now we're sort of onto larger topics here than just Montague's Semantics. But yes, I think this is sort of a general problem of the social sciences, if there really are sciences. I mean, yes, you can do experiments that sort of reconfirm the obvious or something like that. And yes, it's an experiment and you have statistics
SPEAKER_02: 668:53:29-669:01:04 You
RW: 670:38:06-682:41:12 Yeah, I don't know. It's, I mean, it's a...  It's, I guess, because of my years in chemistry and whatever to start, I always found this just not terribly satisfying. I mean, it was, you know, I understand that it's worthwhile to do it and that it can be intellectually engaging and all of that sort of thing, but, you know, I guess it's just not my cup of tea, basically.  No.  But I think the Montague...  semantics. Maybe part of the appeal was that it did seem  to have testable  predictions, you know, in a way that some of the other things did not.
IC: 682:41:12-683:06:47 and also a level of procedure.
RW: 683:05:23-683:37:10 And 11 of precision, right?
IC: 683:32:57-684:57:53 Everything was spelled out once you were able to go through the pen.
RW: 683:55:27-686:31:15 That's right.  Alright.  If it claims that such-and-so is a consequence of this sentence and so forth, well then it's either right or wrong.
IC: 686:23:23-690:31:27 wrong. It predicts a certain kind of like internal patterns for example. Yeah. And you know you should be able to calculate them and then if that goes against the kind of intuitions that you have then you need to decide am I intuitions wrong or is the theory wrong.
RW: 686:32:57-692:33:14 Right.  Yeah.  That's right, yeah. So I think it was a vast improvement over what we had.
IC: 692:27:53-707:39:42 And also, I mean, my understanding, and I brought some with Barbara about this a little bit, because I want to make sure about making this claim, but from what I've seen about the linguistic literature, people that care about meaning, at that time, the idea that entailment is a crucial notion in order to understand the behavior of natural language and the meaning of natural language was not at the center of the agenda at all. That's true. I mean, it was at the center of the philosophy of language when they were working on formal languages.
RW: 698:45:02-699:14:17 was not in the center.  and die.
SPEAKER_02: 699:14:17-699:19:04 Oh
RW: 699:19:04-699:25:32 That's true.
SPEAKER_02: 699:25:32-699:27:47 you
RW: 699:27:47-699:33:08 I mean it was.
SPEAKER_02: 699:33:08-699:33:25 you
RW: 699:33:25-699:37:38 the
SPEAKER_02: 704:11:00-707:48:08 you  you
IC: 707:48:08-714:17:57 you  To me it's always looked like it was Montagu to put it at the center of the table. Sure, he says he referenced an entailment, but in the end it was really crucial, given the fact that he also says that he's not really interested in how words are attached to the world. You need to assume that, but that's not really what the semantic is. What the philosopher does is to show you how once you have those meanings, how you combine them together, and what you get out of that.
RW: 711:08:23-711:10:55 Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: 711:10:55-711:12:19 you
RW: 711:12:19-711:13:27 you
SPEAKER_02: 713:47:34-714:27:14 Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.
IC: 714:27:14-719:34:04 And so both the way you combine them together, so that technique, that formalism, but also the fact that that system allows them to derive entailment, to me those are also look like some major contribution because that's a very bold claim. The claim is that in a human mind there's a certain kind of logic that derives certain kind of patterns.
SPEAKER_02: 717:10:21-717:12:02 you
RW: 718:21:47-719:36:53 Yes it is.  Yes.  Yeah.
IC: 719:36:53-719:52:21 And that's not trivial.
RW: 719:56:17-725:03:59 Yeah, that's right. I mean, generative semantics would say, you know, in some cases, well, we get entailment because it's a sub-tree of this gigantic tree that we've constructed here or something. But of course you can construct that tree any old way. Exactly. So how do you know? How do you know? Well, here you know.
IC: 723:39:02-726:54:14 way. Exactly. You know, how do you know? Here you know because you calculate the meaning, you have the model to interpret, you have like truth conditions and then you check.
RW: 726:46:55-736:53:17 Yeah, exactly. So I guess, you know, so gradually, or maybe not so gradually, I kind of drifted into computer science. I really, you know, I guess at heart, basically, I want to work in mathematics, although I'm not  talented enough to be a real mathematician.  but I like.  Well, first of all, I should say that  I guess.  My particular gift, such as it is, is trying to explain things to people.
IC: 737:03:08-738:34:32 I heard you're a fantastic teacher. I'm sure you'll never have the chance to join a class like this.
RW: 737:57:42-750:10:38 to enjoy the last five days. You told me.
IC: 738:37:04-747:12:36 Now it's over.  I  this
RW: 750:15:42-756:11:12 The computer science department came to the linguistics department and said, we are overloaded with students. We need somebody to teach theory of computation, that is, automata to read machines, you know, that sort of thing. And so there was Stanley, Lowry, and me, right?
IC: 754:20:57-754:36:08 that's where he was.  Yeah.
RW: 756:37:38-763:40:04 And so we took on the job of teaching this for the computer science department.  And that was fine because we got students in the Linguistics Department that, you know, increased our enrollment. We were also the hatchet man for the Computer Science Department. They said we want a very rigorous course and you should fail a lot of people because we have way too many students.
IC: 758:23:23-760:27:08 UGH  you
SPEAKER_02: 760:27:08-764:29:00 Huh?  you  Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehhehuehfhfhffffffffffffffff
RW: 764:29:00-780:23:17 And then, once we got this started, then...  Stanley and Lowry.  the camp to Stanford and I was left alone with this. And so I taught theory of computation I don't know how many times for the computer science department.  Ugh.  but in linguistics and so on.  And then eventually I retired.  and I came out here  And, um...  So...  After a semester of doing nothing, I sent my resume to  Uh oh.  I was in the first year of college.  What is it? It's State University of San Jose. Right, okay. And so they hired me to teach, guess what, you know, theory of computation down there. And I did that for a couple of semesters. And then eventually I got
IC: 776:54:02-777:24:42 State University of St.
RW: 780:33:08-785:36:02 hired at San Francisco State.  And that's what I've been doing ever since, teaching theory of computation.  analysis of algorithms, which is more mathematics of computer science and so forth.  So that's what I'm doing. I'm explaining things to computer scientists.
IC: 784:45:59-788:27:53 That's fantastic and that's how my, well mine, is not officially my student but definitely somebody who has been working very closely with Gary Patterson. That's how he got to know you.
RW: 788:27:19-790:17:34 Exactly, I was going to bring that up. Gary Patterson, you know, found himself in my courses.
IC: 790:05:29-803:00:53 We submitted a Squib at a line and we're waiting to hear if he got accepted. Oh really? Yes. Oh, okay. And he has been helping me very much on this project. I got some grant money to be able to hire him in helping transcribing the interviews because it's way better to have them written down, to recover information and so on. So, and he's a native speaker and he's great at typing and he has knowledge that allows him to understand
RW: 791:41:40-792:21:53 Oh really? Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: 798:37:55-801:21:02 you  Oh!  Ah, wonderful.
RW: 802:37:15-805:40:04 Wonderful, wonderful. I'm hoping to see him next time he comes to the city. I know he comes back periodically, but do you have a spring break for your own quarters?
IC: 805:33:36-816:23:51 We have a quota system, which means that I think this is their finals week. I believe this must be their finals week and then next week... Sorry, no, no, no. It's not yet there. Their finals week is going to be at the end of March. So the last week of March is going to be when they are on a break. And I believe that's when I think Gary is planning to come here. I was talking to him. Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to see you this time because I had to go to Europe for a talk.
RW: 806:00:02-817:17:51 Sirs.  Sorry, not.  Oh  Okay, well that's good to know because I'm listening.  I want to send him an email.  Yeah, yeah. Because he was the one who first mentioned you to me.
IC: 817:04:38-818:03:59 And he is what?  I was the first one that finished with you to me.
RW: 818:03:59-819:14:34 So all of this network is all connected now, right?
IC: 819:14:34-823:39:30 So actually I have two questions related to something that you mentioned. One question is, can you tell me a little bit about the birth of this book? Which was published I think in the early 90s.
RW: 823:28:32-823:54:59 Yeah, it would have been...
IC: 823:48:14-826:07:10 I think 1993 this was the first edition. Yes 1993 let me double check.
RW: 824:32:23-831:28:04 Yes.  Yeah, it looks like... That sounds right. Well, my textbook, Introduction to Mathematical Linguistics, which is the one I was working on when I went to Indiana, and I guess eventually it was published around 1971 or something like that.
SPEAKER_02: 829:21:30-829:29:57 Mm-hmm.
RW: 831:37:21-844:36:25 Ugh.  It was used at various places, but Barbara had also published a textbook on the same kind of stuff. There was a lot of interest in that stuff in those days. But eventually, I think my book went out of print, and I think maybe Barbara's did too. I don't know.  for whatever reason, but the publishers got tired of doing it. My publisher was brand-new and small.  I think they said, oh, it's not selling enough copies anymore, so we're just going to remainder it. So I ran into Barbara at a conference and they said, well, you know, both our books are out of print now and so forth, and it's a shame. And neither of us wants to sort of bring them up to date.
SPEAKER_02: 844:31:55-844:38:40 Hm.
RW: 844:38:40-846:32:00 So we said, why don't we find a third person to combine the two books?
SPEAKER_02: 846:11:45-846:51:42 I'm going to go for a insulin ring.
RW: 846:51:42-850:15:19 And Alice Dermulin was there and we grabbed her and said, Alice, how would you like to do this? And she said, oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: 846:51:59-846:53:57 And
IC: 849:38:45-849:44:23 Let's try it.
RW: 850:18:25-856:37:15 you  I always said, really it won't be much work. I mean, you just have to sort of, you know, merge the two books and, you know, all this sort of thing. And then of course you could write a chapter on, you know, and then of course we have to add some stuff about, uh,  formal semantics and so on, which is not in...  our first books and so on. So that's how this happened. And then
SPEAKER_02: 855:56:45-856:11:06 And
IC: 856:11:06-856:11:23 you
RW: 856:46:49-862:03:30 I remember that  It was in 87, I came out to Stanford for the Linguistic Institute that summer, and Barbara was here, and Alice was here. And that was when we were going to finally put the book together and all agree on the rest of this. Well, of course.
IC: 858:47:12-860:00:36 you  And Alice was here.
SPEAKER_02: 860:00:36-860:08:12 Mm-mm.
IC: 860:59:23-861:01:21 you
SPEAKER_02: 861:01:21-861:10:38 Together.
RW: 862:27:25-863:50:40 things never happen the way it's supposed to happen right
SPEAKER_02: 862:37:49-862:44:34 Thanks for watching!
IC: 863:40:15-865:53:17 No, but I'm glad you did it for me. It was really like, oh, OK, finally I can start understanding.
RW: 865:42:02-869:23:23 Okay.  Well, the idea was to try to publish a book so that nobody else would ever have to publish a book in this, at least not for many years. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Get the whole thing down and be done with it.
IC: 868:26:00-880:12:14 She hit the whole thing down.  Just to give you an example, there was a time when I was trying to understand Ling's article in Plurals. And I had no idea of what lattices and semi-lattices were. And he does not explain them, he just introduces them. And I could not find anybody in my intellectual environment like in philosophy in Italy that I didn't have any serious logician in my department. And so it was thanks to your book that it says, okay, that's what it is, let's see if it works now.
RW: 870:47:45-884:07:55 UGH  you  you  Yeah.  I'm not a-  us.  Yeah, so...  So that was the idea. Eventually we got it done. It wasn't as rancorous a thing as it was with David and Stanley.
IC: 883:47:40-890:05:40 you  Talking about your time at Texas, were you still in Texas when Bill Laduzov was there? Yes. And that was also the time when, because I'm trying to remember, Bill's dissertation chair was Dowdy, is that correct?
RW: 886:49:21-891:12:19 Yes, oh yes.  People  I believe that that would have been right.
IC: 891:12:19-893:04:49 Because so Dowdy got the PhD at Texas and then he got, he was hired by Texas. That's how he do it.
RW: 891:13:10-894:11:45 you  Because  maybe that's true
IC: 893:51:14-895:58:38 Because I'm pretty sure that Daudi was Ladislav's advisor. Or like, you know, the cook.
RW: 895:45:42-896:24:14 Yeah, yeah, the first member that did that.
IC: 896:07:21-896:27:19 That's good.
RW: 896:27:19-896:51:47 right
IC: 896:35:12-896:43:04 I know.
RW: 896:52:55-896:55:10 you
IC: 896:55:10-897:01:55 Oh, my.
RW: 897:01:55-897:08:40 I-
IC: 897:02:12-908:45:02 I'm planning to interview Bill as soon as he has time and I can go to Santa Cruz now. He's the Dean of Humanities there. But I'm pretty sure, and his dissertation was in 1979. Right. Because his dissertation is another important example of application of Monte Carlo grammar. And I would say it's the most important example of a student working with a Monte Carlo grammar that is not coming from UMass.
RW: 905:32:40-916:57:14 Right.  We love you.  having students doing work on. No, it was a very good time and we had Bill Ledgisaw and Jim McCloskey. They were both, I think, in my beginning syntax course. Amazing! And I remember getting quiz papers or something back from Jim McCloskey and I said, this looks like it was written by Noam Chomsky.
IC: 908:47:17-910:42:02 That's right.  you
SPEAKER_02: 910:42:02-913:11:06 Yeah, yeah, yeah.  you  you
RW: 917:02:00-926:05:40 Ha ha ha ha!  Ha!  you  you  I mean, it couldn't be any better and more insightful.  you  Who is this guy anyway? It was just Jim McCloskey who was very smart. We had some really good students. But then when Stan and Lowry left and David went off to Ohio State and people graduated and so forth, it just kind of faded away.
IC: 921:35:23-926:51:47 Yeah, we had some really good students.  you  Yeah, I don't think you've reached those peaks anymore.
RW: 926:51:47-930:03:53 I kind of moved over to computer science and then it just kind of�I don't even know if they teach formal semantics at Texas anymore in Texas.
IC: 926:52:04-926:53:45 Thank you.
RW: 930:11:45-930:21:19 Well
IC: 930:14:34-949:28:32 Well, what they did after... So for a few years they tried to hire like... which I never know if it's the right strategy, but what they tried to do, they tried to hire big names. So Manfred Krithka has been there like periodically, they were trying to have him permanently, but of course, you know, he's not going to give up his German pension, which is way better than anything that the US can offer. At a certain point, I think they were even trying to get Hans Camp.
RW: 933:51:08-933:57:53 I'll see you later.
SPEAKER_02: 933:57:53-933:59:17 you
RW: 934:25:27-939:48:36 Right.  Sure.  Right.  He wasn't going to go for that.
SPEAKER_02: 941:51:47-944:04:15 Road.  Uh-oh.
RW: 947:19:44-951:12:19 That's right.  Well, they got John Beavers. I was about to say John Beavers. Yes, right. It was also in my beginning play.
IC: 949:54:08-951:12:53 John Deere was able to say John Deere is awesome.  you
RW: 951:12:53-951:13:27 you
IC: 951:13:27-951:14:51 you
RW: 951:14:51-951:15:08 you
IC: 951:15:08-974:23:40 Okay, okay. So they have like, I mean they don't have, they rebuilt a little bit but not with the same strength and amount of resources that they had at that time. Clearly it was a very special time for them. Well, I have a very different kind of question. And in this sense, you're one of the few people that is qualified enough to answer this question. So another thing that I'm trying to reconstruct for my book
RW: 951:24:42-954:46:55 Yeah!  So  Yeah, no, it's not.
SPEAKER_02: 955:11:57-955:16:27 Yeah.
RW: 955:16:27-956:54:19 you  Yeah.  you
SPEAKER_02: 956:54:19-957:57:19 Okay.  I
RW: 957:57:19-965:05:57 you  You don't know.
SPEAKER_02: 966:29:12-966:42:25 Yes, sir.
IC: 974:24:14-980:25:21 you  So  This is the picture of a man, but also we are at a time in which being a gay man was very different than being a gay man now, both in terms of how you behave socially and how, not you, how you behave socially, but also how people were aware because they were just aware of the existence of gay people.
SPEAKER_02: 980:18:02-980:25:38 you
IC: 980:25:38-993:18:47 So, one question that I have for you is that if you remember anything obvious behavior at the conference, sitting next to the table, would you like, I mean,  Was he, I don't know how to formulate the question, like, was he flamboyant? Was he very controlled? Was he in that kind of professional setting? Would you have recognized him as a gay man from his way of behaving, his way of talking? And this is about Montague, but also in general, this is more your experience. What did he mean to be a gay man in academia at that time? It's true that Montague was in California, which is not exactly Texas,
RW: 986:11:00-988:11:06 reality.  is
SPEAKER_02: 990:35:40-990:49:27 Alright.
IC: 993:31:27-1007:09:19 I mean, they were like homophobic colleagues in the philosophy department, I think the same was still there, that made life of gay faculty very difficult. That's Berkeley. So I'm trying to imagine what it meant to be like, first of all, a gay student, a graduate student, an undergraduate graduate in Berkeley in the late 40s and 50s, but then later, being a faculty at UCLA in the 60s. So these are the two dimensions
SPEAKER_02: 995:18:53-995:19:10 you
RW: 995:19:10-996:41:00 you  Yes. That's very funny.  Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 1000:39:14-1000:46:32 Yeah.
RW: 1002:44:06-1008:08:57 Yeah.  you know  That's true, that's true. And I don't remember much about...
IC: 1007:19:44-1007:21:08 you
RW: 1008:15:08-1011:11:45 You know, that I think...  Ah, that.  people generally.  knew in some sense that Montague was gay.
SPEAKER_02: 1011:11:45-1011:19:21 you
RW: 1011:12:36-1013:43:21 you  But it was by and large not talked about because Will at the time as you say, it was just a taboo subject.
IC: 1013:28:44-1013:44:29 She was more of a rumor.
RW: 1013:44:29-1016:21:25 It was more of a rumor, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think that's true. But, let's see, I remember
IC: 1014:03:02-1014:44:40 Yeah.  you
RW: 1016:50:06-1019:25:38 Well, I think one of the first really openly-gaze dunes we had at Texas was David Dowdy.
SPEAKER_02: 1019:18:53-1019:26:12 Mm-mm.
RW: 1019:26:12-1026:23:51 He brought his partner to parties and functions and so forth.  you know, just accept it. I mean, nobody really, you know, raised an eyebrow about it. Even in Texas. And that would have been...  what the 70s early 70s I should be in the early 70s you know and Bill Lajesaw
IC: 1025:25:21-1025:48:59 It must have been the early 70s.
RW: 1026:30:36-1032:07:32 was also gay and again I don't think anybody ever  bothered even to mention it or anything. I mean, it was just kind of, you know, well, you know. But it wasn't an open topic, it was just, you know, sort of quietly accepted, I think that's the way it is, yeah.
IC: 1029:37:38-1037:04:49 Thank you.  From your experience, can you imagine somebody, let's say an academic, a young scholar, a young faculty, being discriminated, or like being looked at with a special eye in her or his career because of his sexual orientation?  Well...
RW: 1036:56:23-1049:27:02 Well, I mean, of course it depends. I mean, I came out probably in  of the 1980s, and I don't know that I ever encountered any discrimination of any sort. I mean, no, not really. There wasn't anything that changed in any way that I could see about that.  When I was earlier at Harvard, however, which was back in the 60s, it was an entirely different story. Really, at Harvard. Yes. I know, can you imagine?
IC: 1046:39:59-1048:43:10 Alright, so.  Yes. Really, at Harvard.  I know!
RW: 1049:32:40-1050:54:14 I was a tutor in one of the houses at Harvard.
SPEAKER_02: 1050:32:00-1050:43:32 Uh huh.
RW: 1050:55:55-1058:57:08 And there was a rumor, right, that one of the non-resident tutors was gay or something and that maybe he was involved with one of the undergraduates. Well, he was just summarily fired. I mean, without further ado. Wow.  And it sort of was shocking at the time that it was just...  you know, a summary.
SPEAKER_02: 1058:50:06-1058:51:47 you
RW: 1058:59:06-1063:16:27 judgment, you know, on the part of the housemaster and everything. Well, we won't have that sort of thing going on here, you know. So things changed a lot. I mean, and now of course, you know, there are gay studies at Harvard and...
IC: 1063:20:40-1083:21:19 But actually now you say that something else comes to my mind. Harvard had a famous psychologist. He was the one that basically created the modern field of language development. He created a famous database called Childist, but he was the first one to collect data from these four children and following their development and then make those data available so it was used as a database to check a variety of
RW: 1072:29:40-1072:36:25 English.
SPEAKER_02: 1078:27:42-1082:22:49 Mmm.  you
IC: 1083:34:15-1104:32:00 Their friends knew, but for all those years, he was at Harvard.  until almost the very end.  he didn't come out. And it's pretty clear that it was because he was concerned about his career. So, I mean, because one thing that I'm trying to figure out is what kind of, under what kind of pressure was Montagu? Not necessarily, I think, within the philosophy department. My impression is that the philosophy department, as you said, it was something that was known but not discussed. Graduate students had heard about it, fine. Montagu wouldn't be, Montagu would organize parties at this place, department parties,
SPEAKER_02: 1087:42:02-1094:40:49 Yeah.  That's not just for you.  you
RW: 1094:40:49-1094:42:30 you
SPEAKER_02: 1094:42:30-1094:42:47 you
RW: 1094:42:47-1098:59:34 Of course they can't.  pondering.  You know, we knew.  Yeah.  His name was Bo-  It was never true. This is my part.  you
SPEAKER_02: 1098:59:34-1102:00:42 Yeah.  More.  Yes.
IC: 1104:36:14-1110:30:19 He was gay when I read it on the newspaper when he was murdered and it was pretty clear that this was the implication. So I wanted to be within the department, I don't think it was a problem but I think, I have some facts, a sense of virtue that he was concerned about like more in large like UCLA. In other words somebody that knew about him, about him being gay could have damaged him.
SPEAKER_02: 1106:08:29-1106:14:57 Yeah.
RW: 1109:11:34-1110:56:45 Yeah.  Oh yeah.
IC: 1110:51:59-1111:10:49 Bye.
RW: 1111:10:49-1111:11:57 you
IC: 1111:11:57-1111:18:42 Thanks for sharing.
RW: 1111:13:04-1116:28:55 Well, yeah, if you think about the political climate, even in California at the time, I mean, when Harvey Milk was running for the Board of Supervisors and all that sort of thing, that, yeah, I mean, there was a lot of sentiment that, well, gay teachers should be fired and that sort of thing, you know.
IC: 1112:24:47-1112:36:53 I
RW: 1116:30:19-1123:38:40 Oh.  most of the academic.  world was sort of insulated from that. Nobody said that college for vets, well I'm sure there were people who said that college for vets should be fine. Of course, but I don't think it was ever really a serious political. But at a lower level, yeah, occasionally. Yeah, yeah. I think, you know, growing up at much the same time, you just
IC: 1118:47:51-1119:22:27 I'm  you
SPEAKER_02: 1119:22:27-1119:24:25 you
IC: 1119:24:25-1121:42:47 Of course, there's always that.  But at a lower level, yeah, occasionally.
RW: 1123:54:08-1138:04:38 You just kept it to yourself.  unless somebody needed to know. And if you were particularly courageous or brave or something, then you would, you know, bring your partner out publicly, like at a faculty party or something like that. And, you know, apparently that's sort of what he did. But it was a very different time. It really was a very, very different time. I mean, it's almost unimaginable, right? That, you know, now gay marriage can be,
IC: 1131:38:45-1137:15:08 It's almost unimaginable.  They were
RW: 1138:20:23-1139:40:15 and arresting people for public indecency just for being at a gay bar.
IC: 1139:40:15-1142:33:30 Oh, I see. Well, actually that seems to confirm something that I heard more about LA. Like doing something similar, you know, police targeting.
SPEAKER_02: 1141:24:53-1142:19:44 Uh...  Police
IC: 1142:36:53-1146:35:06 Yes, exactly.
SPEAKER_02: 1142:43:38-1142:45:36 Thanks.
RW: 1146:04:10-1146:55:21 Yes, that could be very interesting.
IC: 1146:36:14-1147:17:17 So that was happening in San Francisco as well.
RW: 1147:20:23-1147:51:19 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was...
IC: 1147:53:34-1147:58:55 Yeah.
RW: 1148:47:34-1150:00:08 It really is unimaginable.
IC: 1149:49:10-1157:47:34 I mean, I was interviewing some gay men of that generation in LA and they told just to have an idea what he meant to be a gay man of Antek's generation in the 60s and one of them told me, well Ivana, police would target those bars, you have to be very careful because if they would come there, he would arrest you and they said, you know, it would be enough for you to offer a drink to a stranger, you would pass the glass and just passing the glass, he would touch his hand, there was obscene acting with like public obscene and whatever and they could arrest you.
RW: 1150:00:42-1158:10:21 you  I know.
IC: 1158:04:10-1163:37:44 And then they said, you know, they would arrest you and you have to pay a fine to be released. And he told me, the fine at that time, remember, like I was making, the guy was working at Macy's or something, so I was making like, you know, as a normal level employee at Macy's, like 50, 60 dollars a month. And the first fine was 250.
RW: 1161:46:04-1161:50:00 normal.
IC: 1163:43:21-1168:43:27 to be released.  Second time would be 500.  So that gives an idea of... And then I read recently that in Chicago it was even worse.  because in Chicago they would do the same thing, but then the following day...  Oh, two days later, your name would be on the major newspaper.  the chicago trivia
SPEAKER_02: 1168:24:19-1168:32:29 that she had
RW: 1168:32:29-1168:32:45 you
SPEAKER_02: 1168:46:49-1168:55:32 you
RW: 1168:55:32-1168:56:06 you
IC: 1168:56:06-1170:26:57 by the liberal like the following people were arrested at the following bars and of course
RW: 1170:25:32-1172:05:57 Yeah, everyone knew what that meant, yeah, of course. Yeah, I know.
IC: 1170:44:40-1172:50:23 Yeah.  Yeah.  This was 40 years ago, like less than 50 years ago.
RW: 1172:41:06-1180:36:42 I know, it's incredible, it's incredible. Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah. So, um...  Yeah, people who were born and came to adulthood at that time I think were  inevitably very deeply scarred by it all because you know I mean it's a  It's a really extreme...  societal attitude, that you're a criminal, secretly a criminal.
IC: 1180:36:42-1197:35:40 Plus with some of them, definitely I'm sure in the case of Montague I have evidence of that. And then in the case of somebody who got close to Montague enough, at the Berkeley time, he was a poet, Robert Duncan. So the two of them got friends. Duncan was ten years older than Montague, but he created the first Berkeley  poetry renaissance and then a few years later in San Francisco around City Light together with others actually it was like  you  the creator of the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance and then Ginsberg and Adar joined in and created the famous group around City Lights. So he was really active and in his biography what emerges clearly is that very early on in high school they got beaten up.  And so the trauma starts from there. You feel like, okay, you are mistreated, people attack you for what you are because you don't respect this kind of stereotype. And so you're constantly in danger.
SPEAKER_02: 1197:41:00-1197:47:45 Yeah.
IC: 1197:47:45-1211:24:14 And that feeling must follow you for your life. I mean it doesn't matter probably how... My impression is that when he went to Berkeley and he discovered his intellectual skills and he discovered fields where that he liked, mathematics, logic, philosophy, and he was very good at. That is empowering. But those scars were there. I think those fears don't disappear. Sure, you feel at home in your field, but you also feel that there is something else in your life that could destroy. You would be successful in that field. It must be very...
SPEAKER_02: 1198:47:40-1198:55:15 you
RW: 1202:57:25-1211:43:55 Yes.  You will be successful in that field. It must be a very... A wrong move could just...  Suck  you  But only you  you  you  and she's all right so the people  At least I'm not.  Yeah.  Well, it's a survival strategy. Yeah, of course.
IC: 1211:42:47-1220:19:44 And then when one of his friends, Tom Kalish, who knew him from the Berkeley time, became not a friend anymore at Berkeley for conflicts that they had, my impression is that really Montague felt in danger because Kalish knew a lot about him. That's exactly the situation in which somebody was very, very close to you, not just as a collaborator but as a friend that saw you in potentially dangerous situations, now is your enemy. What can he do?
SPEAKER_02: 1216:28:15-1220:26:45 It's  Uh-oh.
IC: 1220:20:17-1222:21:30 And so you see this feeling emerge, once again, this feeling emerge because you start from a situation which you felt in danger.
RW: 1222:25:10-1222:59:12 Yeah, exactly, yeah, exactly.
IC: 1222:59:12-1223:12:59 Yeah, no.
RW: 1223:20:34-1225:34:10 It's uh, yeah.  Hopefully we won't have to repeat that kind of...
IC: 1225:02:40-1233:44:40 No, I mean, but I won't try to do my best to render because I think that as you said this is something called an educational thing to let people understand that those were times where people could feel very threatened just because of their sexual orientation. And more generally, there is an entire, a more general lesson here which is not just about sexual orientation, it's about diversity in general. I mean, like, because, you know, instead of sexual orientation, now it could be, I don't know, the color of your skin or it could be other factors that are still used
RW: 1225:48:47-1229:31:15 Yeah.  Stay there.  Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 1229:31:15-1231:17:51 you  you
RW: 1233:14:17-1233:14:34 you
SPEAKER_02: 1233:14:34-1233:21:02 are still
RW: 1233:21:02-1233:22:27 you
IC: 1233:51:42-1235:17:29 you can create major scars into people's life.
RW: 1235:20:00-1246:33:53 Well, I mean it's interesting going to contrast it with Turing, who apparently was quite open, at least for the time, about his homosexuality. But even though it was illegal, and it did, of course, eventually ruin his life and everything, but I think he felt, from what I've read anyway, that he felt sort of insulated from it because of his privilege, his birth and his social status and everything.
IC: 1237:39:30-1265:22:15 Hi.  No. No, not at all. Also, in the case of Turing, which is not Montague, I think Turing is always, I mean, I don't want to do cheap psychology, but I think Turing has always looked to me like a borderline, at least Asperger's syndrome. Which also means this capacity of understanding social, it's never clear. And I read his biography early on when he came out in the mid-80s, and it's a beautiful biography, by the way. But, I mean, the biography leaves you,
SPEAKER_02: 1249:18:42-1249:18:59 you
RW: 1249:26:51-1249:27:08 you
SPEAKER_02: 1249:27:08-1249:28:49 you
RW: 1249:28:49-1249:44:00 Intensely, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 1249:44:00-1249:49:38 Yeah.
RW: 1249:49:38-1249:49:55 you
SPEAKER_02: 1249:49:55-1249:50:29 you
RW: 1252:46:15-1260:16:49 Yeah.  You know.  It was protected by, it was after underneath.  Yes.
SPEAKER_02: 1265:13:32-1265:15:14 you
RW: 1265:15:14-1265:30:25 you  Yeah.
IC: 1265:23:23-1266:50:34 Which made him special and different, and so probably his intelligence protected him up to a certain point.
RW: 1266:09:30-1266:57:02 It's amazing.  Yeah.
IC: 1266:57:02-1276:36:59 But you know, when you go to the British police and say, well, he stole my stuff, what was he doing? Well, we had sex. I mean, look, this is not, I mean, you're not finding any political battles here. You're just clumsy. Yes, yes. Because if you want to find political battles, then you don't put yourself in a position of weakness. You have people behind you or you do it in a different way. That was a dumb move. Yeah. Which to me, like, since he was, I know that he was not dumb. I mean, he was not mentally retarded. Clearly he was totally disconnected. He was unable to,
RW: 1266:57:53-1268:53:29 you  It's just
SPEAKER_02: 1268:53:29-1268:53:45 you
RW: 1270:05:29-1276:37:15 Yes, yes. Because if you want to fight a  Sure.  That was a dumb move.  Yeah.  you
IC: 1276:37:15-1276:39:30 you
RW: 1276:38:06-1277:16:04 you  I think that's probably true.
IC: 1276:39:47-1286:41:40 you  And so it was like, you know, the popularized crazy mathematician. I think it was probably a case of some sort of Asperger's syndrome and difficulty in verbalizing, difficulty in understanding the social norms and the consequences of the social norms. Montagny was young. Montagny was very, very, very well aware of the social norms and how to behave properly and how to protect himself.
RW: 1282:35:34-1282:35:51 you
SPEAKER_02: 1282:35:51-1282:43:10 What are you...
RW: 1282:43:10-1285:25:44 you  Oh yeah.  you
SPEAKER_02: 1285:25:44-1285:27:42 uh
RW: 1285:27:42-1285:31:38 uh
IC: 1286:44:45-1296:01:55 before you say something where you're going, both with your argument, reason, theory, but also in daily life, he was a very successful businessman, so he was able to understand that world as well. And so, in his case, control of the norm and getting ahead. In fact, if anything, the few cases that I heard of him exploding, like this sudden explosion of anger, where explosion which he was expecting you to do something for him because of his role. I'm a professor, I'm doing this,
SPEAKER_02: 1289:49:15-1296:13:10 So.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, the man who is the most important man in the world.
IC: 1296:02:29-1328:33:14 Like as if they were not appreciating him for what he was. And there this trigger, like this explosion of anger, which again you can see probably from traumatic experiences when you are a child and you don't get respected and then you gain the respect towards because of your role in this institution and then people within this institution don't respect you, then you can explode completely out of proportion. The poor parking person, I mean what's his fault if you don't have the parking permit because you forgot it at home?
SPEAKER_02: 1297:03:30-1297:14:12 And there's the man.
RW: 1300:22:55-1302:16:32 because  people.  you
SPEAKER_02: 1302:16:32-1304:11:51 Yes.  Yeah, I'll worry about that.
RW: 1305:32:34-1308:35:57 Oh yeah.  Yeah.  you
SPEAKER_02: 1308:35:57-1311:35:40 No, you must have  you  You feel  Yeah.  I definitely
RW: 1313:37:10-1313:38:00 you
SPEAKER_02: 1313:38:00-1313:52:55 Yes.
RW: 1313:52:55-1317:30:19 you know.  Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: 1318:48:14-1327:21:30 you  you  Yeah.  which you know  Yeah.  Oh yeah, that's what I thought.  It was  you  you
IC: 1328:51:47-1334:58:32 So, you know, you learn in the tough way there. Yes, that's right. When he moved to UCLA, he became impeccable. Yes. There is no sign that he has ever done anything on campus that was less than perfect. Unlike what his trade colleagues were doing, playing around with like young female students, he was impeccable on campus. So he must have learned the lesson very clearly.
RW: 1329:03:53-1337:15:47 You know, you learn.  Yes, that's right  Yes.  Do it!  We must have learned the lesson very clear.  No, I see, of course, yes. Well, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, he was a smart man. He learned from, yeah. But still, he's...
IC: 1336:53:00-1338:57:19 But still, you know that you are constantly in danger because you can make a move. You were still a man with these weaknesses.
RW: 1338:20:45-1338:55:38 Sure.  Yeah.
IC: 1339:02:06-1340:07:38 Yeah, yeah. Well, let's check because I don't want to miss out. What time is it?
RW: 1339:43:44-1339:51:36 I don't miss
IC: 1340:09:53-1340:12:25 you
RW: 1340:12:25-1340:16:04 Let's try this.
SPEAKER_02: 1340:16:04-1340:17:45 you
RW: 1340:17:45-1340:19:44 you
IC: 1340:19:44-1341:39:36 Oh, we should, oh sorry, we should rush because it closes at 12.30. Whoa, great. Sorry, sorry.
RW: 1340:22:15-1341:46:04 Oh, we  Oh, great.  else
IC: 1341:46:04-1342:53:17 No, no, I know Barbie but I mean like...
