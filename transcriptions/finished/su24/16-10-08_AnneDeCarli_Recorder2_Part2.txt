IC: 0:00:00-0:00:11
Okay, this is a recent thing. I can see from there. It's the... 

AD: 0:00:11-0:00:13
Anybody we know there's Paul. 

IC: 0:00:13-0:00:14
That's Paul, yeah. 

AD: 0:00:14-0:00:17
Oh, I think this is an SRI alumni thing. 

IC: 0:00:17-0:00:19
2002, yes. 2002, yeah. Okay. 


AD: 0:00:21-0:00:25
All right. Now what's this all about? 

IC:
Oh, please go ahead. It looks... 
Happy birthday! (Laughter) 


AD:
That's a sister and brother. 

IC:
Ah, I see. Well, I'll say. That's a cute one. 

AD: 0:00:42-0:00:46
I think Liz probably made that with her computer. 

IC: 0:00:46-0:00:49
Oh, this has to do with the diamonds. 

AD: 0:00:49-0:02:05
Yes. A lot of the work that Paul did until the time he retired was testing at the National Test Site near Las Vegas. Now, these are nuclear devices. And his job was developing a means of recording the impact of a blast. So they would attach wires to a bomb, go back to their bunker, set off the bomb, and then try to get records on their instruments before they were destroyed. And most of those experiments had some kind of a certificate like this, with humor and meaningfulness. 


IC:
Yeah, there's also a little bit of his history, like in the military and the diamonds. 

AD:
I'm not sure what the diamond portents, but diamond was very much part of his working life. He developed a way of doing it by dynamic high pressure, meaning you set off a bomb. There was also static high pressure, which means you squeeze hard on a diamond and it formed, I mean carbon and it forms a diamond. 

IC: 0:02:07-0:02:36
That's 1977, the [Count Triomino??? 2:08]


AD:
This is Shirley Temple, you know Shirley Temple? 

IC:
Oh yeah, sure. Oh, you're right, that's her! Yeah, yeah, I mean, when I was a kid, her movies were still very, very popular. 

AD: 0:02:36-0:02:37
Here's Paul. 

IC: 0:02:37-0:02:39
Yes! Is this the same? No, this is a different picture. I was going to say, oh, it's a different... This is... "We are all Irish for a day", I guess it's Saint Patrick's... 

AD:
I think this is a local thing and this is San Francisco... 

IC: 0:02:50-0:02:52
San Francisco, yeah, it looks like San Patrick's Day. 

AD: 0:02:52-0:02:54
He has a different hat on. 

IC: 0:03:00-0:03:22
Yeah, definitely, yeah. 
Oh, inside, yeah. Oh, these are copies of the same. (Yeah.)
Put it all together. That's a real picture. That's a real picture. 

AD:
 With his... 

IC:
Oh, this is like the... 

AD:
Lederhosen. 

IC:
The uniform, like the... Yes, it's not the uniform. 

AD: 0:03:22-0:03:26
The Bavarian. 

IC:
The Bavarian, yeah. 

AD:
So, Paul brought that home from Germany. 

IC: 0:03:26-0:03:31
But not when he went in the army. 

AD: 0:03:31-0:03:36
Yes, when he was in the army. We started having a 4th of July party every year in our backyard. That's what this was. 

IC: 0:03:36-0:03:39
Oh, this is what it was. Yeah. 

AD: 0:03:41-0:03:47
And that looks like a diploma. From where, I don't know. St. Mary's. 

IC: 0:03:47-0:04:04
Oh, Stockton is on the musical daily, a graduate of the Stockton University. On the 12th of June. 

AD: 0:04:04-0:04:06
So that would be the same day as Richard's. 

IC: 0:04:06-0:04:07
Here it is, her signature. 

AD: 0:04:07-0:04:09
Oh, Sister M. David. 

IC: 0:04:09-0:04:47
Yeah. Do you mind if I take a copy of this? Because probably this was on the same day as Richard's. 

AD:
I think so, yes. 

IC:
But I don't have his diploma. And this is the first time that I see Sister David Henry. 

AD:
Yes, it's nice looking isn't it? 

IC: 0:04:47-0:04:54
Yes. 

AD:
Okay, here's his passport. 

IC:
It looks like a recent one... Actually, 1961. At least this is the issue date. 

AD: 0:05:18-0:05:25
Okay, and then there would have been one since then. 

IC: 0:05:25-0:05:45
Probably because this has, I think, at some point expired. 

AD:
Yeah, I think every ten years. 

IC:
Yeah, this says photograph attached. I think every ten years, is it correct? Yeah, in fact this has been cancelled. 

AD:
That's quite a mustache. 

IC:
Yes! So this is when...you guys are just married, 1961. 

AD:
That's right. 

IC:
You were married in 60, is that correct? 

AD: 0:05:45-0:05:56
That's right. And we took a long honeymoon the next year in 1961. We spent five weeks. And that's what that was all about. 

IC: 0:05:58-0:06:00
He did not declare you, though. 

AD: 0:06:02-0:06:03
What is this? 

IC: 0:06:03-0:06:10
So he says, well, I don't know, but it says "Wife: XXX, Minors: ...."
Well at that point there were no kids. 

AD: 0:06:10-0:06:11
No kids, but there was a wife. 

IC: 0:06:11-0:06:12
There was a wife. 

AD: 0:06:12-0:06:13
I don't know! 

IC: 0:06:13-0:06:17
He kept doing... No, it could also be that the practice had started earlier or... 

AD: 0:06:17-0:06:19
So is it... 

IC: 0:06:19-0:06:26
Or unless... No, but you had the right to have your own passport. 

AD:
I did have a passport. 

IC:
It's not that you have to be on your husband's passport. 

AD: 0:06:27-0:06:30
So this is another discharge paper? 

IC: 0:06:30-0:06:34
Yep, it looks like it. 

AD:
Or is this for... 

IC:
Statement of personal history. 

AD: 0:06:34-0:06:37
Oh, this is for... Yeah, for work. We call it security clearance. 

IC: 0:06:37-0:07:19
Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yeah, yeah. All these histories here. So that's St. Agnes, St. Mary's, Stamford. So, until 1952, and then these are the parents, yeah. 
And then I think there was the military activity. I think I saw, yes, here it is. Employment. 

AD:
There was Beale's Greenhouse. 

IC:
Beale's Greenhouse. Then the military service, 52-54. And then 54-present Stanford Research Institute. 
And...credit card test, what are these? 

AD: 0:07:19-0:07:21
These are references. 

IC: 0:07:21-0:07:37
References, probably. [Unintelligible]
Yes, these are the references. And these are the places where he lived. The various times, from the 30s, 70s. Residences. 

AD: 0:07:42-0:07:45
What would this be? That looks like... There's a lens. 

IC: 0:07:45-0:07:48
I think this looks like the negative of what we saw earlier. 

AD: 0:07:48-0:07:49
It does. 

IC: 0:07:49-0:07:52
Yes. 

AD: 0:07:52-0:07:53
Oh, of this? 

IC: 0:07:53-0:08:08
No, the other one. Remember? The one where... 

AD:
 Discharge? 

IC:

Discharge, yes. It looks like from a microfilm, probably. Yes. They must have... because the army, of course, has their own copy of that discharge. In fact, you can find them online, too. And this looks like a printing from a microfilm, the negative. 

AD: 0:08:08-0:08:14
I think that's one of my pay slips. 


IC:
I think. 

AD:
I don't know how it got in this stuff. 

IC: 0:08:14-0:08:18
That's, it looks like another copy of that one. Is it correct? 

AD: 0:08:18-0:08:23
I recognize my employee number. This is from Lockheed during the 80s. I don't know what it's doing in here, misplaced


IC: 0:08:23-0:08:40
Well, you guys were together, so... This looks like, I think, a continue... Yeah, it looks like another copy of what we saw. The St. Agnes... Yes. And this is the... Oh! Birth records. A certified copy. 

AD: 0:08:40-0:08:46
St. Joseph's Hospital in Stockton. 

IC: 0:08:46-0:09:16
Actually, that's the place where Montague was born. St. Joseph was the Catholic hospital. That's the same place the mother went to. So he was born in a hospital. Because people told me... Actually, can I ask you... I'm starting to get a sense for people that were born in the 30s. How common was for a woman in those years to give birth in a hospital versus at home? Do you have any sense? 

AD: 0:09:16-0:09:20
Very common, I think. And to stay there for a week or two. 

IC: 0:09:20-0:09:28
Ah, ok. So it was not the case... You wouldn't go to a hospital only if there was some like complication, like some difficulty? 

AD: 0:09:28-0:09:37
No, it was very common, even in the 30s, even in the depression I believe, for women to be in a hospital for a birth. 

IC: 0:09:37-0:09:42
For a regular birth? (Yeah.)
OK. Were you, do you know if you were born in a hospital? 

AD: 0:09:42-0:09:47
Yes, it was Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley. 

IC: 0:09:47-0:09:54
Oh, you see. You were in Berkeley from the very beginning! 

AD:
That's right. That's where my parents were living. 

IC:
It was in your destiny. 

AD: 0:09:54-0:09:55
What is this? 

IC: 0:09:55-0:10:13
I think it's a cover for Social Security, but it's just a cover. And this looks like a... 

AD:
Birth certificate? 

IC:
Birth certificate, yes. But actually, I wonder if this contained this one, but it just says that something was mailed to you. 

AD: 0:10:13-0:10:20
This says social security number. 


IC:
Keep this with your personal records. 

AD:
It seems as if it should go with this, yeah. 

IC: 0:10:20-0:11:34
And this looks like another... Oh, that's another copy of the discharge. It looks like armed forces regiment, let's see, 54, the air service... Yeah, that's actually, that's the original. In fact, you can read it much better with the original signature on that. Nurseryman, yeah. John Bell Palo Alto. 
And this is headquarters, September 54. Subject transfer, return to reserve. Okay, so that says "You have been transferred to the Army Reserve effective..."
Okay, so on September 29, 1954, he entered reserves. He's not active service anymore. (Okay.)
And again, that's the, yeah. That's the original, that's the original, those were photocopies of this one. This looks more recent, 1998. It's an SRI publication, I guess. 

AD: 0:11:34-0:11:37
Here's Bud Duhb Engelbart. 

IC: 0:11:37-0:11:38
Oh, you knew him? 

AD: 0:11:38-0:11:42
Yes, he was responsible for the bug and the mouse. 

IC: 0:11:42-0:11:44
Oh, wow. 

AD: 0:11:44-0:11:47
It's not called a bug anymore. It's called a cursor. 

IC: 0:11:47-0:11:53
A cursor, yeah. Wow! So he was one of the team, one of the people that I saw? 

AD: 0:11:53-0:11:58
He was part of a group working on computers in the early years. 

IC: 0:12:01-0:12:07
This looks like a note. 

AD:
Looks like a household note or something. 

IC:
Yes. 

AD: 0:12:07-0:12:16
I don't know what this is. 

IC: 0:12:16-0:12:26
This looks like birthday cards and messages. Oh yeah, look at this. Some funny... Oh, I see something from St. Mary. Let's see. Oh, this is look at this. 

AD: 0:12:26-0:12:28
Oh, it is from a friend. 

IC: 0:12:28-0:12:31
William Donald Grimshaw. 

AD: 0:12:31-0:12:47
A classmate at Stanford. He was a physician and unfortunately he took his own life. He had cancer. He didn't treat it. At a certain point he said, it's time to go. 

IC: 0:12:47-0:12:54
Was he...he was not working at SRI? 

AD: 0:12:54-0:13:05
No, he lived in Marysville. He was a physician. 

IC: 0:13:05-0:13:13
Oh, this is the 2007 reunion. Ah! 1927, 2007. Oh yeah, these are some of the names that I remember. 

AD: 0:13:13-0:13:18
Where was this, at a hotel? 

IC: 0:13:18-0:13:21
Brookside or Stockton, Mallard's Restaurant. 

AD: 0:13:21-0:13:35
Yes, I do have some. Gosh, it was less than 10 years ago. This looks like another diploma coming up. Maybe Stanford? I think so. 

IC: 0:13:35-0:13:43
Yes, Stanford Junior University. "To all who own this letter...", oh yeah, look at the fanciness. 

AD: 0:13:43-0:13:45
So the president at that time was Sterling. 

IC: 0:13:45-0:14:07
Yep! Yeah [all-star fonts??? 13:45]. Oh yes, graduation. 
This is a more recent passport, maybe. 

AD:
More recent, yes. 

IC:
Looks like, yeah, 2011. That's the last. That looks the last. 

AD: 0:14:07-0:14:11
And here's a few postcards. I think that was from... 

IC: 0:14:11-0:14:17
I think he wrote you this one, I assume. Yeah. "Dear Anne."


AD: 0:14:17-0:14:24
Oxford. 

IC:
Oh! 

AD:
He spent, so this was 66. I didn't go because I was having a baby at that time. September. Baby was born in October. 

IC: 0:14:24-0:14:25
Okay, clearly you were pregnant. 

AD: 0:14:25-0:14:51
We toyed with the idea of going over and taking advantage of National Health Service, but decided against it. This really was a wonderful time for him. He was invited to sort of mediate between two warring camps. I think he actually came up with a new idea about how carbon molecules could reconfigure themselves, reform themselves. 

IC: 0:14:51-0:14:57
And this happened while he was there? So he spent some time there? Because I see that this is another one. September from London. 

AD: 0:14:57-0:15:05
That's right. It was a conference convened by De Beers, Diamond Company. 

IC: 0:15:05-0:15:07
And another one the day before. 

AD: 0:15:07-0:15:08
Yeah. 

IC: 0:15:08-0:15:11
Clearly this is from England. 

AD: 0:15:11-0:15:15
This is something else. This is when our son was born. John De Carli. 

IC: 0:15:15-0:15:19
But it's still 1966, September 23rd. 

AD: 0:15:19-0:15:25
Yeah. Okay, so John was only two years old. Yeah. Oh, this is... 

IC: 0:15:25-0:15:38
Oh, the train, of course. And this is another for John. So yes. 

AD:
Very good. 

IC:
Yes. 
This looks like a newsletter 2013. 

AD: 0:15:38-0:15:42
Yeah, 2013. "See page 13."
Why should we see page 13? 

IC: 0:15:42-0:15:44
Maybe there's something dedicated to Paul. 

AD: 0:15:44-0:15:47
Yeah, let's see. Yeah. 

IC: 0:15:49-0:16:20
Oh yeah. Actually, I think I found these online too. They posted online when I did a search on Paul. Yeah, I remember this portrait and this picture. They have it on their web page. Yeah, "He was the first to synthesize diamonds from graphite, a shockwave process for which he held the patent."
Oh, he had the patent for that. They say that he was the first one to synthesize diamonds from graphite, a shockwave process for which he held the patent. 

AD: 0:16:20-0:16:27
And SRI got royalties. Oh. Because the method was used commercially. 

IC: 0:16:27-0:16:30
Oh, it was used commercially. Okay, well, that's perfect. 

AD: 0:16:30-0:16:33
To make industrial grade. 

IC: 0:16:33-0:16:34
Sure, sure. 

AD: 0:16:34-0:16:37
Now this is something Paul was working on. 

IC: 0:16:37-0:16:40
Have you asked for the president? 

AD: 0:16:40-0:16:48
This is an interesting theory. So many authors. 

IC: 0:16:48-0:17:05
Yeah, so it was submitted to PNAS. 

AD:
Is it Nature or...? 

IC:
PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It looks like it was accepted. 

AD:
I think it was printed. 

IC:
Yeah, yeah, it looks like, yeah. This looks like proofs, because you have the number here. This is the typical of proofs when they want you to go through and make any changes, so you can say "Line 106, change this, change that."


AD: 0:17:20-0:18:27
Their theory was that a meteorite exploded, not on the earth, but above the earth's surface, created tremendous heat and pressure, burned a lot of vegetation over half the globe, and left a characteristic deposit of soot over a lot of the world. And they think they know about when this happened, it was about 13,000 years ago. And they argue by examining a core sample from a lake bed in Mexico, and there's this characteristic soot, and there's certain little things called spherules, which are fused earth from great heat and pressure. What else? There are nanodiamonds, not just microdiamonds, but nanodiamonds from intense heat and pressure. That's what they argued. I love this theory. It's so fast! 

IC: 0:18:27-0:18:29
Yeah, I mean it's impressive. 

AD: 0:18:29-0:18:31
It includes a lot of the earth. 

IC: 0:18:31-0:18:46
Now I understand why you have so many authors, because probably you also need a variety of competences to put all this together. Actually I didn't realize that SRI would also focus on such broad issues. 

AD: 0:18:46-0:18:49
Well, SRI did not, but Paul did. 

IC: 0:18:49-0:18:59
Oh, okay. So this is coming from his own interest. Because I thought it was more specific in their research. 

AD: 0:18:59-0:19:33
No, but one thing led to another. He began working for SRI in 1954, I think I said. And he went to work for the Poulter Laboratory, which during the war was interested in shaped charges. A spin-off, a private spin-off, was called Jet Axe, so that you could explode your way out of the cabin of an airplane and deploy your parachute. You could explode things for safety reasons. 

IC: 0:19:33-0:19:35
Yes, yes, yes. 

AD: 0:19:35-0:20:48
After the war, they turned to high pressure. And so, when Paul went to work, he was schooled in X-ray technology, so you could study minerals, the effects of blasts on minerals. They did a lot of testing by firing a bullet at something down in the basement, or by going out to Calaveras, I don't know if you know Calaveras, across the bay, where there was a test site, experimental test site, where you could explode things. And then, of course, there was a national test site where you could really make a big bang. 
So that's what Paul did. He learned a lot about explosive and high pressure. When he retired, lucky for him, he got to keep his office and the library and the laboratory and his colleagues. And he could indulge things. 

IC:
 In this kind of research. 

AD:
Some interests that had developed while he was learning this stuff. But it took the form of meteorites and stuff like this. 

IC: 0:20:48-0:21:20
Well, I can see for this kind of project, somebody with this knowledge, like since you are studying what this external core may have done in terms of pressure and the explosion of the trigger, clearly it's something that I can see why he was fascinated and I can also see how he could contribute to this. And this looks recent. Do you know when he was working on... Because well, since it was still the proof, so you don't see the date. But it looks like their current format. That's what I'm saying. It must be within the last 10 years. 

AD: 0:21:20-0:21:24
Yes, it is. Even more. Within the last five. 

IC: 0:21:24-0:21:26
Because that's definitely the format that they use now. 

AD: 0:21:26-0:21:27
Yeah. 

IC: 0:21:29-0:21:38
Wow, fascinating. 
That's another copy of the letter. Another SRI thing. 

AD: 0:21:41-0:22:03
So this is about the service for Paul, I think. 

IC:
Was it here in Menlo Park? 

AD:
It was at SRI. 
[Crosstalk.]

Probably something about having to do with the service. Oh, it's from SRI. 

IC: 0:22:03-0:22:06
That's something that you submitted, I believe. 

AD: 0:22:06-0:22:10
This went into several papers, including the Stockton Record. 

IC: 0:22:10-0:23:25
Yeah, yes, yes, I found it there, and I also found it on others, yeah. When I was looking for Paul, when I first saw his name, because that's when I tried to look for you, and I think I wrote you once, and I got it back. So I wrote you at Menlo Park, because if you do a search online, you can still find records of the house that you guys had in Menlo Park. Now I thought, well, I knew at that point I already found his obituary so I realized that Paul was no longer alive. But I thought, well, you know, your name was still there and I thought maybe Anne still lives there. So I think this was one month before I, or maybe even two months before I contacted your son. I wrote you a letter to your old address, but then the letter came back. And it said, could not be forwarded. And I said, hmm. So how can I look for it? I said, DeCarli is not that common in the US. Let's say that the family stayed, you know, they were living in the Bay Area, like in Menlo Park. Maybe she don't move too far away. I started doing a search and then I saw John DeCarli. And I saw his age, because you can see the age, I said, hmm, it could be their son. I mean, it would work. 

AD: 0:23:25-0:23:26
Good thinking! 

IC: 0:23:26-0:24:16
And so what intrigued me, what made me think that maybe it was the right one, is that at a certain point... This day you can find lots of information. As far as John was concerned, at a certain point he lived in Menlo Park. And I said, "Aha, here we are. John DeCarli in San Francisco lived in Menlo Park, Ann and Paul lived in Menlo Park. They must be related. If not, the son is somebody close to the family. Let me write it. That's where the message started."


AD:
Very good work. 

IC:
Well, you know, after four and a half years, I try everything. And because, you know, sure, 10 times, you know, once works. But that one can be very, very important. And that's how I found you. But also that's how... Can I open the envelope inside here? Actually, you can tell me if you want. It looks like some color pictures. 

AD: 0:24:20-0:24:25
Oh, this is a vacation in the Southern California desert. 

IC: 0:24:25-0:24:26
Oh, nice. 

AD: 0:24:26-0:24:28
This is an old oven. 

IC: 0:24:28-0:24:32
Oh, yeah, yeah, an old style oven. Yes, open air oven. 

AD: 0:24:32-0:24:36
I think it's a Sierra Club tree. It looks as if the... 

IC: 0:24:36-0:24:40
Yeah, something happened to the vehicle. A little bit too much mud there. 

AD: 0:24:40-0:24:49
See, there's a great big desert state park, Anza Borrego. 

IC: 0:24:49-0:24:51
Anza Borrego. Anza Borrego, yeah, it's very close to San Diego. 

AD:
I think I was there. 

IC:
Yes, we've been there a few times. 

AD: 0:24:51-0:25:07
And I think this is a family party. 


IC:
1971. 

AD:
Who are the... this is Paul's sister. I think these are his two sisters. Too bad they're not looking at the camera. And who's that? I don't know. 

IC: 0:25:07-0:25:09
Yeah, it says November 1971. 

AD: 0:25:09-0:25:11
Yeah, that's the Menlo Park house. 

IC: 0:25:11-0:25:13
Oh, that's the house there. 

AD: 0:25:13-0:25:17
These are our tenants, by the way. There was a little cottage on the property. 

IC: 0:25:17-0:25:21
Oh, nice. Like it was an independent structure? 

AD: 0:25:21-0:25:25
Yeah, they were closed, but self-contained. 

IC: 0:25:25-0:25:28
Annual Ultra Labor Union. It's for you. 

AD: 0:25:28-0:25:30
Okay. That's my daughter. 

IC:
She was little here. 

AD: 0:25:32-0:25:48
Yeah, she was in nursery school, Bing Nursery School on the Stanford campus. When she was born, my friend advised me "Sign her up for Bing Nursery School right now."


IC: 0:25:48-0:25:55
Oh, good suggestion. So you booked, oh, this is Paul. Where was he? Do you recognize him here? 

AD: 0:25:55-0:26:05
Where is this? Out in the desert, I should think, 1973. That was probably some field work near Las Vegas. 

IC: 0:26:05-0:26:08
And this is like January 1972. That's Paul for sure. 

AD: 0:26:08-0:26:17
Yeah, this is our brother-in-law, my sister's husband. They looked so studious together. (Yeah.)
So serious. 

IC: 0:26:17-0:26:20
Oh, this is a beautiful one. 

AD: 0:26:20-0:26:23
This is cute. This is from the nursery school. 

IC: 0:26:23-0:26:24
I thought so. Nice. 

AD: 0:26:24-0:26:29
Yeah, here's me and here's our girl. 

IC: 0:26:29-0:26:32
Did she like going to this school? 

AD: 0:26:32-0:26:45
Yeah, kids do like it. It's so loud. They've had hills bulldozed into existence. It's very big. There are enough toys for all the children. Kids don't have to compete for toys because there's plenty for every body. 

IC: 0:26:45-0:26:50
That's the ideal place. It looks like you guys are on a trip here. 

AD: 0:26:50-0:27:02
Yeah, this looks like a vacation trip. I think it was either the same or another desert trip. Looks like the Sierra. 

IC: 0:27:02-0:27:08
The Sierra, yeah, with all the snow. 

AD: 0:27:08-0:27:20
Historical plaque, here's our boy, here's our girl. This was close to UCSD. I think... What happened? I think we took John down for a sort of introductory visit. 

IC: 0:27:20-0:27:24
Out to explore the area and see if he liked it. 

AD: 0:27:24-0:27:27
A day or two, an intro. Something like that. And then the whole family got together. 

IC: 0:27:27-0:27:43
Nice. Now this is a beautiful thing about San Diego, you drive two hours east and you're really in the desert. (Yes.)
I mean like, Anza Borrego is beautiful and it's like less than two hours from San Diego. Yeah, it's so... And you drive like another hour or even less and you are in Joshua Tree. 

AD: 0:27:43-0:27:43
Uh-huh. See this is Anza Borrego, yes. 

IC: 0:27:44-0:27:45
Oh, here you're doing some other activity. Oh, Cuyamaca, yes. That's the... Probably those are the mountains. So that's the same... You're on the water there. 

AD: 0:27:55-0:28:03
Same area. Oh, wait a minute. This is... No, this is in... It's east of Stockton. It's a... 

IC: 0:28:03-0:28:09
Oh, the Lake Tahoe... No? What's the name of that big lake where people go, is it Lake Tahoe? 

AD: 0:28:09-0:28:35
No, it's a reservoir. It's closer to Jackson. Oh, my brother-in-law took us with his boat. I can't think of the name of it. But it's a reservoir. It's not a natural lake. But everybody had fun. That's Paul's overseas cabin. 

IC: 0:28:35-0:28:41
Yeah, that you recognize from the picture, yeah, definitely. This is a passport from early 2000. 

AD: 0:28:41-0:29:00
Still another one? 

IC:
Yeah, yeah, from early 2000. 

AD:
Early 2000 probably this one got a lot of business. We did a lot of traveling together. We got in the habit of going to certain conferences every year which tended to be in nice places. This looks like a


IC: 0:29:00-0:29:05
That's the way to do it. This looks like a performance of the [mikado??? 29:02]. 

AD: 0:29:05-0:29:10
Yes, from 1960. (60, yes!)
He was singing in a little Gilbert and Sullivan troupe at the time we married. 

IC: 0:29:10-0:29:11
Wow! 

AD: 0:29:11-0:29:16
And so some of these people we still know. 

IC: 0:29:16-0:29:17
Wow. 

AD: 0:29:17-0:29:18
Or did know. 

IC: 0:29:18-0:29:23
Palo Alto High School Auditorium, yeah? 

AD:
Yeah. 

IC:
April 23, 1960. 

AD: 0:29:23-0:29:26
Yeah, he enjoyed that a lot. 

IC: 0:29:26-0:29:39
This looks, oh, this is a miniature of the military. It's a small form of the form that we saw earlier. 
Is this an invitation? 1966? 

AD: 0:29:39-0:29:40
Oh, this is... 

IC: 0:29:40-0:29:46
The International Diamond Conference. 

AD:
That's right. 

IC:
Maybe one of those that you were mentioning. 

AD:
Yeah, the Oxford. 

IC: 0:29:46-0:29:47
That's a nice place. I would go there. 

AD:
Well, yeah. 

IC: 0:29:47-0:29:52
Even more so in the summer. 

AD:
International, yeah. Hosted by De Beers. 

IC:
This looks like a graduation picture. 

AD: 0:29:52-0:30:18
Oh, that's... Paul assisted a student to...he helped her get her PhD. This was at University College in London. 


IC:
In London, oh. 

AD:
He had some colleagues there. And he assisted Emma with her thesis. She came and stayed with us for a while. 

IC: 0:30:18-0:30:19
Nice! 

AD: 0:30:19-0:31:09
By age 25, Emma was already very well traveled. She stayed in Japan,Arizona 


IC:
She's originally from London, from England? 

AD:
Yes. Her family grew up in a town called, come on in I'll think of it in a minute. It's out of London. It was on the East Coast, so the Romans came there. 


IC:
Yeah, I think I know what... Not Perth. 

AD:
[Bren means bert, coal means??? 30:56]
We went and visited her and her family there. 

IC: 0:31:09-0:31:14
Is there, on the east part... I can't make it out. 
So these are, this is a copy of the report. 

AD:
There's another in his pod, too. 

IC: 0:31:27-0:31:30
These are some pictures. It looks like he's giving a talk there. 

AD: 0:31:30-0:31:50
Oh yeah. I can't remember where this was. This is his colleagues. Here he's preparing for a trip to Siberia (Wow!), and it would have had to do with international nuclear weapons testing. 

IC: 0:31:50-0:31:51
I can imagine. 

AD: 0:31:51-0:32:03
They didn't actually go, but he did go to a school in New Hampshire, I think, and they practiced working with cold stuff in cold weather, handling cables in cold weather, that sort of thing. 

IC: 0:32:03-0:32:11
I hope for you that you didn't join him in this trip. 

AD:
I did not. 

IC:
It doesn't sound that appealing. It's not Oxford. 

AD: 0:32:11-0:32:20
The nuclear test ban treaty and "trust but verify", that sort of thing. He would have gone to Siberia. 

IC: 0:32:22-0:32:27
It was a good thing that he didn't go there. This looks like a series of receipt or reports. 

AD: 0:32:27-0:32:28
This is probably just... 

IC: 0:32:28-0:32:31
Yeah, like there are receipts of something. 

AD: 0:32:31-0:32:33
Oh, I think I sold this bassoon. 

IC: 0:32:33-0:32:35
Yeah, I think these are receipts. 

AD: 0:32:35-0:32:44
We had two bassoons. I gave one away, sold one. Let's see if there's anything. How are you doing for time? 

IC: 0:32:44-0:33:11
Let me double check actually, I've been taking a lot of your time. Let me see, I don't even know, I don't get so involved. 

AD:
You said you had to be there... 

IC:
Oh, 3.24, oh! Sorry. 

AD:
You have to... 

IC:
I didn't realize that it was... I thought it was still 2.30. Sorry, I have to rush to... 

AD:
That's quite all right. 

IC:
Sorry, I mean, and sorry for taking so much of your time. 

AD:
Well, that's quite all right. 

IC:
I didn't want to. 

AD:
It's been very enjoyable. 

IC:
I completely forgot. I was so taken by this wonderful trip through time and people. 

AD: 0:33:11-0:33:15
I think you better do what you have to do. 


IC:
Yes, yes. 

AD:
I'll see you down to your car. 

IC: 0:33:15-0:33:16
Yes. 

AD: 0:33:16-0:33:18
Let's make sure you get all your stuff. 

IC: 0:33:18-0:33:25
Okay, so let me put, so this is yours. Let me get my recorders, also because I want to record the memorial as well, so I'm going to use them.
