IC: 0:00:00-0:00:18
Sure, sure, Ed. So, one thing that I had in mind, Ed, if you don't mind repeating those two moments of interaction that you had with Richard. In particular, I was thinking, you told me, let's see if I remember correctly, one was the story of your parents were managing a store. Oh, yeah. Remember correctly?

EB: 0:00:19-0:00:20
Yeah, this was during the war.

IC: 0:00:20-0:00:20
Yeah, during, yes.

EB: 0:00:20-0:00:22
About 1944, I guess. Yes, -huh. Yeah, my parents owned a little grocery store.

IC: 0:00:22-0:00:22
Was it in Stockton?

EB: 0:00:22-0:00:37
In Stockton North Wilson Way you know a little mom-and-pop store about the size of a 7-eleven. Store is still there but now it's a liquor store I believe

IC: 0:00:37-0:00:42
Oh is it still there?

EB:
Yeah

IC:
You remember the address? I'm curious since I'll be in Stockton maybe I can drive there

EB: 0:00:42-0:00:54
Yeah it's just a couple, it's actually two blocks north of Harding Way on Wilson Way. (Okay so) So on Wilson Way two blocks north of Harding on the right side.

IC: 0:00:54-0:00:57
Wilson Way two blocks north and

EB: 0:00:57-0:01:01
You'll see it's the only liquor store there that's on the right so it should be real easy to find.

IC: 0:01:01-0:01:02
Okay, thank you.

EB: 0:01:02-0:01:42
No, so I was saying, during the war, you know, after school, I used to go over there and work in the store. I used to stock shelves and wait on customers. So I was telling Rich about it one day, and he said, "Well, man, do you mind if I come over with you someday after school?" I said, "Hey, hey, no, that'd be great!"
So we took the bus from school and went out to the store, you know, and I was stocking shelves and old Rich, he was really excited about it. So helped me stock the shelves, you know, and I just showed him how we did everything. I waited on customers and Rich was standing there watching everything. I think he loved it. You know, I don't think he's ever had that kind of experience before. You know, being out like that.

IC:
Very likely. Because, you know, he was an only child, overprotected, and I don't think he would have any kind of like...

EB: 0:01:56-0:02:09
I don't think he had a social... You know, after I talked to you, I remembered, when were in high school, he never had a girlfriend or never went out with girls and never went to any of the school dances.

IC: 0:02:10-0:02:21
I want to ask you, Ed, so did the school organize, like, dances, events? Because from some of the pictures on the yearbooks that I saw, it looked like you guys were going, like, sometimes it looks like you were skiing, maybe, or you were going to school. Okay, so can you tell me, like...?

EB: 0:02:23-0:02:43
You know, we would have school dances three or four times a year and we'd have a senior ditch day. I think those pictures I sent you yes were from a senior ditch day, and we also had a junior-senior ditch day. So the ones I sent you I don't know if they did you any good.

IC: 0:02:43-0:02:46
Yeah, yeah, I made some copies because they gave me an idea of like...

EB: 0:02:46-0:03:08
The ones I gave you were, some of them were taken at Pinecrest above Sonora, which now is a ski resort during the winter. But they had the lake there. And during the summer, we used to, a lot of the high school guys used to go up there.

IC: 0:03:08-0:03:10
You guys drive there? How do you go there?

EB: 0:03:10-0:03:15
Yeah, we used to drive. We hitchhiked a couple of times. A couple of us hitchhiked, or we drove.

IC: 0:03:15-0:03:20
Can I ask you, Ed, how old did you have to be at that time to drive? You had to be 18, you had to be 16, do you remember?

EB: 0:03:21-0:03:23
You had to be 16 to get a driver's license. Yeah, so that's when I got mine. I know my brother, older brother taught me how to drive. My folks had an old 29 Buick. We used to call it the Bomber in high school. It was huge. Anyway, those pictures were taken at Pinecrest, and some of those pictures was during junior, senior ditch day, and they were taken at Marsh Creek. Had a little swimming pool, a little kind of a resort area, and that was near Walnut Creek, just east of Walnut Creek, I don't know, 15, 20 miles, but it was an easy drive from Stockton. So we had school activities there. But yeah, we used to get together, but Rich wasn't interested. Couples used to get together and double date go out we used to rent motor scooters you know.

IC: 0:04:28-0:04:34
To go the water, like..?

EB: 0:04:34-0:04:46
No, motor scooters. They're a lot different than they were today.

IC:
Really?

EB:
Well they were just little small motor scooters and it only sat two people they wouldn't go very fast. But it was fun riding around town, you know? And that type of thing.

IC: 0:04:46-0:04:50
So in that sense, like, Richard wouldn't participate with this kind of activities?

EB: 0:04:50-0:05:08
No, I haven't seen Rich, I don't remember seeing Rich at any of the ditch days. And I know I never saw him at a school dance, or I never saw him, or even heard of him going out on a date with girls. I think his mother must have really been sheltering him, or I don't know.

IC: 0:05:08-0:05:54
Yeah, I mean, like, unfortunately, you know, she died a long time ago, and she was the youngest daughter of a large family, so she was the youngest one and the others died earlier. And Richard was an only child, and they had him when they were already old. Well old like for that time. Actually you can tell me. So Richard's parents got married relatively young but they had him 15 years after the marriage. So the mother was 30 almost 36 and the father was 41. How common was, I mean these days is not uncommon for a couple to have a child when... (Oh no, no.)
But at that time was it kind of uncommon for a couple that had been married for 15 years to have their first child at that age? Do you have sense?

EB: 0:05:54-0:05:59
I don't know. I don't have any idea to tell you the truth. I know there were seven kids in our family.

IC: 0:05:59-0:06:01
Okay, so...

EB: 0:06:01-0:06:04
I think my mother had them when she started at about 18.

IC: 0:06:04-0:06:06
Okay, okay, so yeah.

EB: 0:06:06-0:06:35
But I really don't know, because I can't answer that question. Did Rich ever get married?

IC:
No, he didn't.

EB:
Oh, he never got married?

IC:
No, he never got married.

EB:
I'm sorry, he was kind of a loner. Well, he had friends at school, but they were all like myself and Richard Huddleston, there was a picture of him standing next to Rich, I believe, in the yearbook. But I think Richard Huddleston, he's dead now, but I think that he was one of Rich's closest friends.

IC: 0:06:35-0:06:36
Oh, I see.

EB: 0:06:36-0:07:01
Yeah, and I think they used to hang out together during recess. But I don't know if they ever went out together or did anything after school or anything but we saw them quite together. Quite often we saw those two, Richard Huddleston and Richard Montague. And I know in the yearbook it there's a picture of Rich and Rich. It was a group picture, but I believe they were standing next to each other.

IC: 0:07:04-0:07:14
I'll check, yeah, if those pictures... Oh, actually, yeah, maybe you can recognize... I think I remember the name now that you mentioned it, because, you know, there were so many names.

EB: 0:07:14-0:07:14
Oh, yeah, yeah.

IC: 0:07:14-0:07:34
I think I made a copy of... I mean, these are, like, bigger copies of those pictures, so the quality is very low, but...

EB:
Oh, right.

IC:
Let's see, this Oh, this... (shuffles through photos)

EB:
There's Rich there.

IC:
That's Rich. Yeah, these are all pictures with Richard. Let's see. This...

EB:
Yeah, there he is.

IC:
So that's Richard, and that's the other Richard.

EB:
This Richard Huddleston.

IC: 0:07:36-0:10:56
Oh, these are the two Richards.

EB: 0:07:37-0:07:45
Yeah, so they stayed right... That's Rich there, and then there's Rich Huddleston. I think they were probably better friends than Rich was with anybody else.

EB: 0:07:46-0:07:51
Boy, these kids, there's actually...Too bad you couldn't take these on a color printer or something.

IC: 0:07:51-0:07:56
Well, the thing is that they are, yeah, they're all black and white.

EB: 0:07:56-0:07:58
Yeah, but I mean, the resolution would have been so much sharper.

IC: 0:07:58-0:08:22
No, no, no. Okay, so what happens is this actually, this one of the highest possible resolutions. It's the original picture that they're are like, because remember, the original picture is this size.

EB:
Oh, I got you. You increased it.

IC: 0:08:22-0:08:27
You increase it to make it easier, but what happens is since the picture was not that high quality because it got printed on a book. Had I had the negative, it would have been fantastic. Yeah. But probably nobody has the negatives of those pictures these days. So I just made them bigger, but...

EB: 0:08:27-0:08:33
Oh, I thought that might have been Bill McFaul but I don't think it is. Did you talk to Bill?

IC: 0:08:33-0:08:49
I talked to him yeah by email. So he now lives north of here so he contacted me by email and we had a little bit of a email correspondence 

EB:
Oh good.

IC:
So because you see this is actually bigger, but this closer.

EB:
Oh, yeah, that's better. Yeah, that looks a little better.

IC: 0:08:49-0:08:52
Then it gets a little bit, actually, your regional is a little bit smaller than this.

EB: 0:08:52-0:12:12
Right, right.

EB: 0:08:53-0:08:53
Well, good. I'm glad you got all these pictures.

IC: 0:08:53-0:09:13
Yeah, so no, the yearbook was very useful. And, for example, something interesting, you see, this a picture from the War Bond Committee.

EB:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

IC:
1944, 1945 I think.

EB:
Was Rich on that one?

IC:
Interestingly I mean they list all the names. They don't list his name, but I think that's him.

EB: 0:09:13-0:09:16
I noticed that too. I saw Richard and I said "I wonder why the name isn't on there?"
That's Rich alright.

IC: 0:09:19-0:09:25
I have one more question for you in case, I know it's hard to do but I found another picture. Sometimes the yearbooks have these pictures at the end, the last page.

EB: 0:09:25-0:12:45
Oh, I didn't see that one.

IC: 0:09:25-0:09:36
Do you think, this could be him, don't you think?

EB:
Oh, that is him.

IC:
I think it's him.

EB:
Oh yeah, no doubt.

IC:
Oh, okay, okay.

EB: 0:09:36-0:09:37
No doubt. That's him. I didn't realize that he rode a bike to school.

IC: 0:09:40-0:09:40
Me neither. So that picture was important.

EB: 0:09:40-0:13:00
You know, I didn't see that. I looked at all those pictures.

IC: 0:09:45-0:09:49
It's like one of those pictures sometimes in the yearbook.

EB:
At the end of the book.

IC: 0:09:49-0:09:53
At the of end the book where

EB: 0:09:49-0:13:09
They had the whole student body.

IC:
Exactly. Put them all together.

EB: 0:09:53-0:09:57
Well, I missed that. I'm sorry I missed that. Yeah, that's a good, actually, that's a pretty good picture of him.

IC: 0:09:57-0:10:03
Yeah, yeah, I know. I like it.

EB: 0:10:03-0:10:10
So this was either in 46 or 47, because those were the yearbook years. Those were the only two yearbooks I had.

IC: 0:10:10-0:10:14
Ed, I forgot to mention another thing. I found, when I went to St. Mary's, I found the 43-44. That's where it was.

EB: 0:10:18-0:10:21
Oh, so it wasn't in the yearbook?

IC: 0:10:21-0:10:22
No, this was his first year at St. Mary's. So I have two pictures from his first year.

EB: 0:10:22-0:10:24
That's why I didn't see it.

IC: 0:10:24-0:10:24
Oh, you're right. Richard Huddleston is here.

EB: 0:10:24-0:10:25
Yeah, see, there's his buddy.

IC: 0:10:25-0:10:28
So he's playing the piano.

EB: 0:10:28-0:10:32
That's what I was telling you. That was the other story I was telling you about.

IC: 0:10:32-0:10:33
Can you tell me that story?

EB: 0:10:33-0:11:10
Yeah, during assembly, you know,
we used to have assembly for the whole student body once a month.

IC:
It was once a month?

EB:
Yeah, once a month. And we'd meet in the assembly room. They had a big assembly room upstairs and Rich was the official accompanist. But he would also, he'd always play this high classical music kind of stuff. So I know one day we start razzing him about, "hey don't you know any boogie woogie or can't you play any swing?"
And he turned around and looked and man he went back to his piano and he started to pop out boogie woogie and it was really good.

IC:
Really?

EB:
By ear! He played everything by ear. Yeah he was a great piano player. I know Mary and Benny and those guys will probably tell you the same thing.

IC: 0:11:19-0:11:24
Yeah I'm curious to hear from them because you know, know like later on... Oh, are you okay?

EB: 0:11:23-0:11:42
Well, I'm on blood thinner thinner. You know, I have some heart problems, so they got me on blood thinner. And I fell yesterday. And every time I bump my elbow, I break the skin. That's why I got all these damn bandages on. And this one, I just have trouble stopping. That's what this.

IC: 0:11:42-0:11:45
Oh, yeah, yeah, no no no!
I realize, I just want to check. Is there anything that we can do?

EB: 0:11:45-0:11:46
I'll put on a new bandage when we get through here.

IC: 0:11:46-0:11:49
Yeah, take a break. Why don't you take a break? No, no.

EB: 0:11:49-0:11:50
It's okay for now.

IC: 0:11:50-0:11:50
Are you sure?

EB: 0:11:50-0:11:51
Yeah, I better go. Let me go clean the table.

IC: 0:11:54-0:11:54
Take your time.

EB: 0:11:54-0:12:09
I don't want that to dry. That picture that you had of the Rich playing the piano? Which one was that?

IC: 0:12:09-0:12:21
I think it was right here. Let me see. The one that was taken in his first year. That was 1943, 44. Where did I put it? Not this one. No, here it is. This one here.

EB: 0:12:21-0:12:25
Yeah, well, see, with all the kids standing around there,
I wouldn't be surprised if he was beating out a little swing music or boogie-woogie.

IC: 0:12:29-0:12:30
Probably.

EB: 0:12:31-0:12:33
There's Richard Huddleston again. They were pretty good friends, I think.

IC: 0:12:37-0:12:44
So Richard is not alive anymore? I don't see his name in the list. So Richard Huddleston?

EB: 0:12:44-0:12:45
No, I know he's dead. I saw that in the school annual or semi-annual magazine a few years ago.

IC: 0:12:55-0:12:58
Do you know if he stayed in Stockton or if he moved away?

EB: 0:12:58-0:13:04
I don't really know what happened happen to him at all. Maybe maybe mary Mary or Bernice or Benny might know but I don't know.

IC: 0:13:04-0:13:04
So can I ask you, going back to when he was playing the piano so it was common for when you have the call the assembly...?

EB: 0:13:16-0:13:23
Yeah he was the official, in fact I think in the yearbook he even said he was the official accompanist at the assembly. So we'd sing songs and Rich would be on the piano playing them.

IC: 0:13:32-0:13:33
Nice.

EB: 0:13:33-0:13:36
So that was his job. So I think Sister David asked him to do it and he did it. So yeah, he usually played piano every time, time once a month when we had the assembly. Yeah we always sang a song or two.

IC: 0:13:48-0:14:00
You know later on I mean like people that got to know him later in college or when he was a professor at UCLA. So what they told me is that he was a very high level organist fact I think in his last year in Stockton and then all his years in Berkeley when he was a graduate student he had a double job. He was working as a graduate student and then he was hired every year from a different congregation in the Oakland area to be the official, like (Organist?)
Yeah the master of music. So the organ and the choir director. And in fact, I think I have a picture here I last actually, I don't know if you, it's a very poor picture. I tried to blow it up, but the quality of the picture to begin with is very poor. But so it's here it is. It's a senior. It was from your yearbook.

EB: 0:14:37-0:14:39
The senior choir. Oh, this was taken in the cathedral.

IC: 0:14:39-0:14:42
Right, that's what I thought.

EB: 0:14:42-0:14:43
Right next door to the same area. Yeah.

IC: 0:14:43-0:15:08
Do you think it's possible? I know it's very good look, this Richard?

EB:
This here?

IC:
Yeah, with the one in the back.

EB:
No, that looks like a girl.

IC:
Do you think this one here?

EB:
Oh, I can't tell.

IC:
Yes, it's totally alright, because what I saw, I got the transcripts, St. Mary's gave me Richard's transcripts. And I noticed that in his last year, actually for the last two years, he took a class that was called Chorale.

EB: 0:15:09-0:15:09
Chorale?

IC: 0:15:09-0:15:23
Which I assume had to do with the choir. And I know that Richard was hired by the Catholic Church after he graduated in 1947 for one year. He was hired as the organist and the choir director.

EB: 0:15:24-0:15:26
It could be him if you look at it from the back.

IC: 0:15:27-0:15:36
Yeah, he has a small frame.

EB:
Yeah, but I couldn't say for sure.

IC:
I know, I know. Me neither.

EB: 0:15:36-0:15:38
I remember the old choir, the old senior choir.

IC: 0:15:39-0:15:43
So there was a choir in the school independently from the church?

EB: 0:15:43-0:15:44
Yeah, yeah.

IC: 0:15:44-0:15:45
Ah, okay.

EB: 0:15:45-0:16:17
Yeah, they used to have regular choir practices.

IC:
During the school year?

EB:
During the school, and then, you know, every student at St. Mary's was required to go to church. You know, whenever the Catholics went to church, whether you were Catholic or not, you had to attend the Mass or whatever was happening in the church. And at the Masses, the choir is the one that used to sing.

IC:
I see.

EB:
So, you know, I don't know if Richard, he may even play, I don't know if he played the organ.

IC: 0:16:17-0:16:29
So I know for sure that from 1947 to 1948, the Church of the Annunciation hired him officially. So he was hired and he was paid after he graduated.

EB: 0:16:29-0:16:33
Of course, the choir, the organ wasn't right here.

IC: 0:16:33-0:19:53
It was down above.

EB: 0:16:33-0:16:40
Let me see if I see Mary or Benny or anybody in here. You could ask them tomorrow.

IC: 0:16:40-0:16:44
Yeah, I'll ask them, definitely, because I think they were in the choir, I think.

EB: 0:16:47-0:16:50
Oh, there's Paul DeCarli. He's the guy that I was telling you was also a professor at Stanford.

IC: 0:16:50-0:16:56
I tried to contact, actually.

EB: 0:16:56-0:16:56
Is he still alive?

IC: 0:16:56-0:16:58
No, Paul died three years ago. 2013.

EB: 0:16:58-0:16:58
That's what I thought.

IC: 0:16:59-0:17:07
But his wife and his children are alive, so I tried to contact his wife, but I got the letter back. But now I think I found his son. I just wrote him yesterday. His son lives in San Francisco. So I explained what it is, and maybe he may have some material or something he may remember.

EB: 0:17:18-0:17:20
Yeah, I don't see Mary Phelan or Bernice Pratt.

IC: 0:17:20-0:17:31
Unfortunately, the original picture is a small one and it's very low quality. So I tried to blow it up, but you see the results. So it's really hard.

EB: 0:17:31-0:17:31
So I can't help you out there.

IC: 0:17:32-0:17:39
No, no, but that's been really great. And I have the same question about, in general, like, from whatever you remember about St.Mary's and also, you know...

EB: 0:17:39-0:17:40
About the what?

IC: 0:17:40-0:17:52
About St. Mary's and your experience there. Because what I want to do in this chapter, I would like to describe Richard at St. Mary's, and therefore also St. Mary's, what it meant to be a high school student at St. Mary's. How was the life there? You know, like, how was the atmosphere? For example, one question that I have for you is that I saw from the yearbooks that you were heavily involved with sports.

EB:
Yeah, right.

IC:
You were in a variety of teams, you were the leader and so on.

EB: 0:18:03-0:18:09
In fact, I was inducted into the St. Mary's Athletic Hall of Fame

IC: 0:18:09-0:18:10
Oh hey!

EB: 0:18:10-0:18:12
I think it was 2016.

IC: 0:18:12-0:18:19
Congratulations! Was it a family tradition in your family to be into sports or you were the sporty one?

EB: 0:18:19-0:18:26
Well my brothers also played sports but I was a better athlete than them. You know, they played basketball.

IC: 0:18:26-0:18:28
I saw some Bakaratt name. How do you pronounce your last name?

EB: 0:18:28-0:18:31
Barakatt.

IC:
Barakatt.

EB:
Yeah, my brother Tom played basketball.

IC: 0:18:31-0:18:32
I saw Tom, yes.

EB: 0:18:32-0:18:33
And my brother Jim played basketball.

IC: 0:18:33-0:18:37
I saw Jim, yes. I saw them. They were in the picture.

EB: 0:18:37-0:18:42
So, but I played, I was serious about it. And they just kind of played it as a hobby.

IC: 0:18:43-0:18:43
So you really liked it and you put in...

EB: 0:18:45-0:19:01
In fact I put in more time in sports than I did in studying which I'm sorry about that now because I'm not as smart as a lot of other people and I never went to college after. You know I don't think my grades would let me in anyway. I was not a good student student. I hate to say it.

IC: 0:19:01-0:19:02
But you loved sports.

EB: 0:19:04-0:19:14
I was a good athlete athlete, but not a good student. No but the life, you know, the class, our class had only 55 kids in it.

IC: 0:19:14-0:19:15
Oh, so it was a small one.

EB: 0:19:15-0:19:20
So yeah, so you, and in the whole school, I bet there couldn't have been more than 300 students.

IC: 0:19:20-0:19:21
Okay, good.

EB: 0:19:21-0:19:25
You knew almost everybody by name, you know, in almost every class.

IC: 0:19:25-0:19:29
So, Ed, can you give me an idea? So you said your class was roughly 55 students.

EB: 0:19:30-0:19:30
Yeah.

IC: 0:19:31-0:19:51
You know, I went, I grew up in Italy, so I'm familiar with Italian school system, which probably is different. So you guys were 55 of you, but how were classes structured? Like for example, when there was the history class or Latin or math all you 55, or were divided into units?

EB: 0:19:51-0:20:03
Oh no people different took different classes. 
So I think the classes probably didn't have more 25 people in each class but you never took all the subjects.

IC: 0:20:05-0:20:07
You could choose your subjects.

EB: 0:20:07-0:20:10
When you were a freshman, you were required to take Latin. You had to take Latin.

IC: 0:20:10-0:20:10
You had to take Latin.

EB: 0:20:11-0:20:16
I flunked out of Latin. I told you I'm not a very good student. But you had to take Latin.

IC: 0:20:16-0:20:17
Well, look you got, so don't go, I mean...

EB: 0:20:19-0:20:32
Yeah, you had to take Latin, and you had to take English, and you and you had to take history. And some of the other classes like typing, you didn't have to take. you know Mrs. Ligorio I think she might have taught shorthand. Ask Mary and Bernice.

IC: 0:20:34-0:20:36
I'll ask them yeah.

EB: 0:20:36-0:20:44
The more I got to thinking about it I'd think well my sisters knew shorthand the only place they could have learned it was in high school.

IC: 0:20:44-0:20:47
Yeah that's probably where Richard learned shorthand.

EB: 0:20:47-0:20:57
Ligorio was the only lay teacher probably taught typing and shorthand. But ask Mary and Bernice tomorrow when you see them.

IC: 0:20:57-0:21:02
And so there were some required classes and then you guys would take...

EB: 0:21:02-0:21:09
Yeah and then you took... I like the algebra and I like mechanical drawing. You didn't have to take mechanical drawing.

IC: 0:21:09-0:21:11
But it was an option there was

EB: 0:21:11-0:21:25
Yeah it was the only class I got an A in so no wonder I liked it, right? I think Benny might have taken it too. But mechanical drawing get believe it was mostly for boys. I don't think a lot of the girls were interested in that.

IC: 0:21:27-0:21:27
And who was teaching mechanical drawing? Was it still a nun?

EB: 0:21:30-0:21:37
No, it was one of the nuns. But I forget which nun it was, I'll actually tell you the truth. Might have been Sister Jordan.

IC: 0:21:38-0:21:38
But it was definitely a nun?

EB: 0:21:40-0:21:44
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Because the only thing Liguori taught was typing and shorthand. That's the only class she had.

IC: 0:21:45-0:21:55
What memories do you have of those teachers, of those nuns? Were they kind or more on the severe side?

EB: 0:21:55-0:22:17
No, no. None of them were. They were all serious. I know that. They were all serious. And a couple of them had a pretty good sense of humor. But they never gave you a hard time. Even if you got out of line, you went into the principal's office, and Sister David would, of course, chew your butt upside down, but she never threatened anything. But, no, they were all really good nuns, nuns and they were good teachers teachers, and they really knew their business. I've never seen except for the one nun, I told you about that incident about when I knocked the Sister Gregory's flower that was the only time I ever saw a nun get mad. In all my four years that was the only time that...

IC: 0:22:40-0:22:44
You were a freshman at that time?

EB:
Yeah I was a freshman

IC:
And you told me thatyou were playing with a friend of yours?

EB: 0:22:45-0:22:46
Yeah, Eddie Brennan.

IC: 0:22:46-0:22:49
Ah, yeah, Eddie Brennan.

EB: 0:22:49-0:26:09
Eddie Brennan.

IC: 0:22:49-0:22:50
You guys were playing together.

EB: 0:22:50-0:22:54
Yeah, well, we were in class. Class hadn't started yet.

IC: 0:22:54-0:22:54
Okay.

EB: 0:22:54-0:23:19
And were just horse playing, you know, kind of shoving each other around.

IC:
Sure.

EB:
So she had this pot on the window sill, and the window was open. So Eddie kind of gave me a shove and I went over the window and I knocked the pot off and it fell down in two stories and broke on the cement. And that's the only time I ever saw any nun really get personally mad. In fact she came over and slapped my face.

IC: 0:23:19-0:23:24
Do you remember which of the nuns?

EB: 0:23:24-0:23:25
It was Sister Gregory.

IC:
Sister Gregory.

EB:
Hell I'll never forget her.

IC: 0:23:27-0:23:33
I know that it's a long time ago and you were very young, but do you have a sense of like how old those nuns could have been? Are we talking about like your parents age or older than that?

EB: 0:23:39-0:23:40
Yeah, they're probably I would say 30s and 40s. I think I think Sister David might have been in her early 50s.

IC: 0:23:47-0:23:47
Okay.

EB: 0:23:47-0:24:12
But I'm trying to think, was there an old one there? I think Sister Jordan was the oldest one, and she might have been in her late 50s or early 60s.

IC:
Okay.

EB:
All the other nuns were, you know, I don't think any of them were in their 20s, well but I think probably most of them in were in their 30s and 40s. That's my recollection, I don't... Mary and the girls would probably know more about that than I do.

IC: 0:24:12-0:24:22
I have a question about the same areas and the people that would go to St. Mary's. So St. Mary's was, yes it still is a Catholic high school but it was also open to non Catholics

EB: 0:24:22-0:24:29
Oh yeah, it was open to anybody, but whether you were a Catholic or not, you had to take the religion class.

IC: 0:24:29-0:24:31
You had to take it anyway, so there was a religion class.

EB: 0:24:31-0:24:41
And you had to go to church when the whole school went to church. That was the agreement when you signed up. This kid, Bob Sherwood.

IC: 0:24:41-0:24:42
Uh huh, yes.

EB: 0:24:42-0:25:16
Sherwood was a very religious guy. And he actually, after he got out of college, he became a Protestant minister. You know, and I think he's living up in Grass Valley someplace. And I don't know if he's still alive even. But anyway, during religion class, Sister David used to teach religion class. And Bob Sherwood challenged her on almost every one of the Catholic teachings. And he really he made some pretty good points but of course if sister David countered and it was fun to watch the two go at it, you know?

IC: 0:25:16-0:25:22
So and Sister David would let the student engage her? She wouldn't stop him say, "What you say? Shut up, don't..."

EB: 0:25:23-0:25:43
Oh no, no. They used to have a discussione-on-one, you know. It was none of that. They could say whatever they wanted, you know, especially the non-Catholics that challenged her. She'd listen to them, and she'd answer them back, and they'd answer her. Sherwood, he was famous for that. In almost every religion class that I had that he was there,
He was always in there, you know. But we never went to religion class every day, you know, maybe once a week or twice a week or something like that.

IC: 0:25:52-0:25:58
And so do you remember to have taken any class with Richard?

EB: 0:25:58-0:25:59
Any what?

IC: 0:25:59-0:26:01
Have you taken any class with Richard?

EB: 0:26:01-0:26:07
With Richard? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I think he was in mechanical drawing, and he might have been in algebra and some of those classes.

IC: 0:26:07-0:26:14
So do you remember if he was already brilliant at that point? Because, you know, later he became a very brilliant student when he was at...

EB: 0:26:14-0:26:15
Oh, you mean Richard Montague?

IC: 0:26:15-0:26:16
Richard Montague.

EB: 0:26:16-0:26:17
Oh, yeah, I thought you were talking about Sherwood.

IC: 0:26:17-0:26:21
No, no, Richard Montague. Sorry, Richard Montague. Have you taken any class where there was Richard Montague in?

EB: 0:26:22-0:26:27
Yeah, I think I an took algebra class with him in geometry.

IC: 0:26:27-0:26:28
Was he good at those?

EB: 0:26:28-0:26:29
He was smart.

IC: 0:26:29-0:26:32
It was already clear that he was smart?

EB: 0:26:32-0:26:50
I think he was probably one of the smartest in our whole senior class. He got straight A's, you know? And he made that honor society every month, you know. From our freshman through our senior year and you had to get all A's and some B's I think to make it. I think Rich was probably a straight a student.

IC: 0:26:52-0:26:56
I went to check his transcripts there was all A's.

EB: 0:26:56-0:27:06
That's what I remember about he's the smartest guy in the school you know and he played the piano well and the only thing is he just didn't socialize much or go out with girls.

IC: 0:27:08-0:27:18
Based on what you remember so based on my experience in high school I remember that there were two kind of people that you don't socialize. They were the people that were like very shy you know they are very shy and...

EB: 0:27:18-0:27:20
I think Rich might have been shy...

IC: 0:27:21-0:27:33
then there are people that just feel like you know, how can you describe it? That one says "Mmm you are not good enough for me."
Okay you know there's those people that have that kind of attitude of like well "I'm way above you so I don't want..."

EB: 0:27:33-0:28:28
Nobody ever had an opinion about Rich like that. I think we probably figure that well you know probably really shy and wasn't interested in going out with girls or going to dances. But never did anybody ever think that he was different or he was a bad guy and you'd want to associate with him. You'd be lucky if he would have you as his friend to tell you the truth. (Really?) He really would would, yeah. I mean mean, we got along really good. You know like he wanted to go to at the store. In algebra I think I even had him help me with algebra couple of times. The guy was smart. (Was he?)
I think Mary and Bernice and Benny will tell you the same thing that they might have thought that he was probably the smartest one in the whole class, too.

IC: 0:28:28-0:28:40
I was intrigued by what you told me about the day that you guys went to the store together.

EB:
Oh, yeah.

IC:
I was wondering, one of the tasks that you guys did together was to arrange things on shelves?

EB: 0:28:40-0:29:05
Yeah, yeah. Whenever any of the inventory was low you know we're in the back room and got the like, if we're stacking canned corn, soda pop, whatever it was. And we just go in the back room and get the case and bring it out to the shelf and take him out of the case and mark the price on it and put it on the shelf. So Rich helped me take it out of the case case, and I said "You mark marked the price. Your handwriting is better."
So he used to mark the prices on the cans or whatever it was were stacking.

IC: 0:29:12-0:29:24
Because later on in his life, you see when his mind develops, you see a great fascination for everything that is organized and systematic.

EB:
Oh, yeah.

IC:
Everything that has a rule.

EB: 0:29:24-0:29:24
Oh, yeah

IC: 0:29:25-0:29:40
In his own job and academic achievement but also in other things. For example a friend told me that when they he got married Richard was at the wedding and at a certain point this friend of Richard was very much into Scottish dance. (Oh!)
And so Richard then was not familiar with it, and you know Scottish dance is one of those dances that you do in a group using very geometric pattern. And Richard got completely obsessed with it fascinated, wanted to learn the rules and got himself engaged. Like he tried to dance following the rules...

EB:
Good for him.

IC:
So there is a this fascination for like this geometric regular patterns and things are each thing has its own...

EB: 0:30:04-0:30:05
Was this in college?

IC: 0:30:05-0:30:21
After college. It was 1969 so Richard was 38 at that point, he was already a professor at UCLA and that guy was a young visiting professor that came to UCLA to study with Richard during his sabbatical.

EB: 0:30:21-0:30:22
Right.

IC: 0:30:22-0:30:43
And so they became very close and actually UCLA this young professor also found his new wife, his first wife. And they got married and Richard was invited at the wedding in Los Angeles oh. And that's where in both the young professor, his name is Max, and both Max and his wife were very much into Scottish dance. Richard didn't know about it when he saw them dance and asked, "how does it work?"
And so Max explained to him the rules and Richard was totally fascinated. Memorized the pattern, wanted to follow the pattern.

EB:
Good for him.

IC:
Yeah, he was very much into it.

EB: 0:31:00-0:31:15
Well, I think what I was saying, I thought when went over to the store after school, he was really excited about it. You know, he'd never done anything like that before. And, man, he was all smile, you know, and he enjoyed that.

IC: 0:31:15-0:31:27
So, one thing I want to ask you, since you were very much into sports and you have an idea, and, you know, I see that the yearbook spends quite a bit of pages on sports and activities. How important were sports at St. Mary's in those years?

EB: 0:31:27-0:32:13
Well, it was pretty important. You know, we really had a small amount of students. And some of the teams we fielded, like the basketball teams, were really good. And when I was there playing football, our football teams were not very good because we never had that many guys going out for them. You know, some of our teams, I remember going to Dos Palos, playing Dos Palos, and we only had 20 guys. You know, we never had the volume of players, or just a lot of guys wanted to go out and play, play and we and we never won we never won a lot of games, football games. Now basketball was different. We had some great basketball athletes like the [Toso??? 32:12] twins and Glenn...

IC: 0:32:13-0:32:15
I saw them yes

EB: 0:32:15-0:32:54
They were terrific in fact one of Toso's was inducted in the Athletic Hall of Fame. And so we had championship basketball teams. And baseball teams, we had a pretty good team. Tosos were also outstanding in baseball. We probably won more games than we lost. But I think for the people that participated in it, it was important. You know, we always get a nice little write-up in the Stockton record, you know, about the team, whether we won or lost. So everybody was, you know, at least the athletes were tickled pink to see that.

IC: 0:32:55-0:33:02
And so was, first of all, what was your favorite sport among the various sports that you played?

EB: 0:33:02-0:36:22
Football. Oh, I love football.

IC: 0:33:02-0:33:04
You like football, yeah.

EB: 0:33:04-0:33:15
I played football and basketball, and I tried baseball in my freshman year. I didn't care for baseball. I only played baseball one year, but I played basketball and football for three years.

IC: 0:33:15-0:33:25
So if you were an athlete like you, would St. Mary's give you fellowships? Or you had to pay the regular fees oh yeah

EB: 0:33:25-0:33:27
There was no scholarship not for St. Mary's absolutely not.

IC: 0:33:29-0:33:42
And so do you remember because I'm trying to get a sense of how difficult it was for a family to send a kid to St. Mary's. Do you remember if St. Mary's was expensive? It was a private school but was it expensive or was?

EB: 0:33:42-0:33:46
Well no actually there were seven of us kids yeah that went to St. Mary's High School. And when my older sister and brother started I think the tuition was like three dollars a month.

IC: 0:33:59-0:33:59
Oh, each?

EB: 0:33:59-0:34:35
Three dollars a month each. (Okay!)
Then when my other two sisters, no, in fact, I think it was $2, because when my other sisters, there was my brother and myself and my two sisters, there was four of us in high school at the same time. (Okay.)
So my mother went and met with Monsignor McGough and said, you know, my parents didn't have a lot of money in those days. They said, "Well, we really can't pay a lot of tuition."
So he says, "Okay. He says, can you pay $6 a month for all four?"
So that's what they paid. They paid $6 a month.

IC: 0:34:38-0:34:41
So the regular, you thought it was like $2 or $3 a month?

EB: 0:34:41-0:34:44
Yeah, when my oldest sister started, it was something like that. Two or three. Or I know it was it was a lot less than six dollars because that
the total that was a max that they ever paid. (Oh wow). And of course when my oldest brother graduated they never reduced the tuition, it was still six bucks you know. And all my two sisters graduated it was still six bucks. That was fair.

IC: 0:35:03-0:35:29
At that point it was the family contribution. I see. So going back to the playing sports if you were a guy in St. Mary's and you were not playing sports. First of all, dod the majority of guys at St. Mary's play sports or it was just a little group, an elite, and the others were not?

EB: 0:35:29-0:35:44
No, not the majority. Just the boys that liked athletics played sports. And that was not the majority. In fact, it was surely a minority.

IC: 0:35:44-0:35:53
Did you guys also have teams, what are called, like, the one, the teams that don't compete with other schools, but just...

EB:
Intramural.

IC:
Intramural, yes.

EB: 0:35:53-0:39:13
Yeah, yeah, that's what I was telling you. Rich was on an intramural team one year.

IC: 0:35:56-0:36:03
Uh-huh. Do you remember what kind of sports that could have been?

EB:
It was softball.

IC:
Did you convince him, or it was just...

EB: 0:36:03-0:36:22
No, no, you know what, what? I don't really know why he decided to play, but he only played one year.

IC:
Softball.

EB:
We used to play just the other classes, you know, like the seniors play the juniors and the juniors, the sophomores and so forth. And every year there was a school championship, whether it was the seniors or the juniors, you know. They had a regular little tournament or something, something set up so you played every other team and whoever won the most, I guess, was a school champ. So in our junior year, we had a terrific softball pitcher. Now, he became pro after he graduated, made the big time. And we were juniors there and this guy's name was Bill Simone. And when he pitched, the seniors, they had all the good athletes, the Tosos and Miller and Arby. All the good athletes were seniors when we were juniors. But we had the one pitcher. So the softball pitcher, when we played the seniors, the softball pitcher didn't let him get one hit. So we beat him good. So we became intramural champions that year. (Wow.)
We were juniors. Juniors. Yeah. I don't remember, I don't think were champions when were seniors.

IC: 0:37:17-0:37:20
But Richard joined you guys when he was senior.

EB: 0:37:20-0:37:25
I don't know, you know, I'm not really sure what year he played. It might have been junior, senior. I'm really not sure.

IC: 0:37:25-0:37:26
But do you remember, were you in the very same team when he played in the softball team? Do you remember him being in the team?

EB: 0:37:31-0:37:38
Well, yeah, we had to be, but I don't really remember Rich actually getting in and playing a lot. I just don't remember. I wish I could answer that, but I can't recall that.

IC: 0:37:40-0:37:45
Do you remember, was Richard kind of clumsy with his body? I mean, you were not...

EB: 0:37:45-0:37:48
Well, he was not athletic.

IC: 0:37:48-0:37:48
Yeah, okay.

EB: 0:37:48-0:38:09
You know, I don't know. He was, I hate to say, kind of moved, you know, like a feminine or something. But not really. He's just not athletic. And he never got, you know, I don't think he ever did any of the exercises that the athletes did. And I'm surprised. I don't even remember him riding his bike to school, to tell you the truth. I don't know. I can't answer. I don't think he was very athletic at all, you know, for whatever reason. I don't think he ever got involved in athletics except for that, just that one year. And he probably played out in the outfield somewhere. I don't remember him getting up at bat or anything.

IC: 0:38:32-0:38:39
So I have one question that has to do with before St. Mary's. Do you remember which school did you go to before St. Mary's?

EB: 0:38:39-0:38:40
Well, I went to a public school.

IC: 0:38:40-0:38:41
Yeah, and do you remember the name of that public school?

EB: 0:38:41-0:39:01
Oh, yeah, I went to, it was in Stockton. It was Lincoln Grammar School, 1st to 6th grade. And then I had to go over to Jefferson School through the 7th and 8th grades. So I had to go six years to public school and then two years to public school. Then we went into St. Mary's Catholic School.

IC: 0:39:03-0:39:28
One question that I have for you is, do you remember if at that time in Stockton there were... 
Because, so I got the transcripts and the transcripts of St. Mary's say the school where you come from. It's under the label "previous training" that indicates which school the student was coming from. And in the case of Richard they wrote El Dorado.

EB: 0:39:28-0:39:30
El Dorado's a public school.

IC: 0:39:30-0:39:31
It was a public school?

EB: 0:39:31-0:39:31
Oh yeah, it's on the corner of Harding Way and Pacific Avenue

IC: 0:39:39-0:39:40
Huh so a public school similar to the one you went?

EB: 0:39:40-0:39:47
Well no, El Dorado was a eight-year school.

IC:
You go there from one first to eighth grade?

EB:
Yeah, because that's where my daughter went when she was younger.

IC: 0:39:48-0:39:49
Okay.

EB: 0:39:49-0:39:51
So, yeah, that was a full eight-year school.

IC: 0:39:51-0:39:51
Okay.

EB: 0:39:51-0:39:53
So he came from El Dorado? I didn't know that.

IC: 0:39:53-0:40:07
Well, actually, I think what happened is that I know for sure that up to a certain grade, he went to Jackson School. You know, Jackson School was a, I think it was from one to eighth grade, but it was south.

EB:
It was in south---?

IC:
Yeah

EB: 0:40:07-0:40:08
Jackson Grammar School was in south Stockton.

IC: 0:40:08-0:40:16
And the parents were living there and Montague, Richard lived there with the parents until he was 10 or 11. Then they moved very close to St. Mary's but that was before...

EB: 0:40:21-0:40:22
So that's in the El Dorado school district.

IC: 0:40:22-0:40:42
In the El Dorado school district, so now it makes sense why... So probably he went for like four or five grades. He went to Jackson. Sorry, what's it called? Yes, Jackson School, when they were living there. (Right.)
Then the family, I think, became a little bit wealthier, was able to buy a, I guess, you know, the neighborhood got better because it's close to St. Mary's.

EB: 0:40:42-0:40:45
Oh, yeah. El Dorado School is a good neighborhood. They have some nicer homes out there.

IC: 0:40:45-0:40:50
In fact, they got a home. And so they used to live in a... What's it called? A duplex?

EB: 0:40:50-0:40:52
Yeah, you know what street that was on?

IC: 0:40:52-0:41:17
Yes. Let me see. I have the map in my mind. It's two blocks from Jackson. From where Jackson School used to be.

EB:
You mean in south Stockton, when they lived in south Stockton?

IC:
The house where they end up going was right next to the Church of the Annunciation is on a street called Van Buren.

EB: 0:41:17-0:41:17
Oh yeah, Van Buren.

IC: 0:41:17-0:41:35
I went to see it you know and now Van Buren, there's the square in front of the Church of the Annunciation, and they built that medical facility. And so the house used to be where now there is one of the medical facilities. There is a part of Van Buren... Well, now,

EB: 0:41:35-0:41:43
Wait, now. I don't think we're talking about the cathedral of the Annunciation. I don't think there's a medical facility across the street from that.

IC: 0:41:43-0:41:47
There is, okay. If you are at the entrance of the church, there is one on the right.

EB: 0:41:47-0:41:48
Oh, okay.

IC: 0:41:48-0:42:20
Because on the right there is a big medical facility. Over on that side. And if you cross the square, on the other side, there is something like medical offices.

EB:
Right. Okay, I thought you were talking directly across the street from the main entrance.

IC:
No, no, no. So if you cross the square, there are these medical offices that are right on the corner. And I think there were at least two or three homes there. And I think the Montague's home was, if not the last one, the one before the last one. So the house got destroyed. But the neighborhood was definitely better than the previous neighborhood.

EB: 0:42:20-0:42:27
Yeah, they had some nice houses. Of course, in those days, during the 40s, those were really nice houses.

IC: 0:42:27-0:42:34
So where did your family live at that time? When you were going to the Annunciation, sorry, to St. Mary's?

EB: 0:42:34-0:42:59
Well, we lived on East Main Street in Stockton, which isn't even close to St. Mary's. We had to take a bus and transfer once. So we lived in the 1400 block on East Main just a block off of Wilson Way. You know and I'm telling you about my parent's market. (Yeah.)
Well Wilson Way was one block from where we lived. (Oh.)
But if you go north about a mile and a half or maybe two miles that's where the store was. Because it was I think it was like in the seventeen or eighteen hundred block
I'm not sure. But it's two blocks north of Harding Way.

IC: 0:43:13-0:43:17
So when you guys were going to school you would take the bus?

EB: 0:43:17-0:43:19
We'd take the bus, oh yeah, we'd take the bus.

IC: 0:43:19-0:43:23
Was there anybody that was going to school by car?

EB: 0:43:23-0:43:25
Well in high school there was. Charlie Rizzo was and one of the Wallace's, I forget which one. In fact there was a picture in the yearbook of a couple of cars that were parked next to the school.

IC: 0:43:38-0:43:41
I was wondering yes so those could have been students' cars? EB: 0:44:08-0:44:15
You want me to go get those?

IC:
Yeah, sure, sure.

EB:
I know Charlie Rizzo owned a car. Their parents owned a real nice restaurant, so they were considered really wealthy.

IC: 0:44:15-0:44:29
Initially, Ed, about being wealthy, do you have a sense that of the people that were at St. Mary's, as far as the economic status was concerned, was there variation?

EB: 0:44:29-0:44:37
Yeah, most of them. Actually, most were just low income. And then there were some pretty well-off people. And then there was a lot of middle class.

IC: 0:44:37-0:44:39
Middle class, okay. It was really a mix.

EB: 0:44:39-0:44:48
Okay. Now, this Jeep in here belonged to a guy named Peter Maringo.

IC:
Oh, a student?

EB:
Yeah, he was a student.

IC: 0:44:48-0:44:48
Okay, fancy that.

EB: 0:44:48-0:44:58
So he had the car.

IC:
That's another car, clearly.

EB:
Yeah, I don't... Well, that was Elodie Russell. That was her parents' car. In fact, I think that's, one of those gals is Bernice Pereni.

IC: 0:45:08-0:45:10
I'm going to meet tomorrow.

EB: 0:45:11-0:45:20
You know this was like a senior ditch day. And this Harold Tardio was a junior when we were seniors and this was Harold's car.

IC: 0:45:24-0:45:25
What's his last name again, Harold?

EB: 0:45:25-0:45:26
Tardio. T-A-R-D-I-O.

IC: 0:45:26-0:45:28
Tardio. Yeah, yeah, I think I saw it.

EB: 0:45:28-0:45:36
Let me see.

IC:
That's another car there.

EB:
Yeah, but I don't know whose car that is. I don't know if it belonged to one of the gals.

IC: 0:45:39-0:45:47
Actually, Ed, can I ask you about driving? Was it common in those days for a woman to drive, or it was mainly a man's activity?

EB: 0:45:47-0:45:48
No, no, yeah, girls would drive.

IC: 0:45:48-0:45:49
Okay, they'd take the...

EB: 0:45:49-0:45:50
Yeah, girls could drive. They didn't have any problem. Let's see, I thought there was another car in here. Charlie Rizzo. I don't remember seeing that.

IC: 0:46:04-0:46:06
Now these are two girls here. Let's see.

EB: 0:46:08-0:46:09
Yeah, I'm not sure whose car that is there. You know, it might have been one of these gals. That's Francis Chisholm. She was in our class. And Nadine Presto, she was a year behind us, I believe. Oh, there's Peter Maringo. There's Bill McFaul, I believe. You talked to Bill.

IC: 0:46:37-0:46:38
Yes.

EB: 0:46:40-0:46:42
There's Don Gamboni.

IC: 0:46:42-0:46:45
Yes, yes, yes. I remember. He looks like he's a graduation teacher.

EB: 0:46:45-0:46:46
You told me he passed away. Did you verify that?

IC: 0:46:48-0:46:49
I went to check.

EB: 0:46:50-0:46:52
Because we were really good friends. I know his sister would have called me if...

IC: 0:46:55-0:50:40
Let me show you what it's based on. So, this what I got from St. Mary's. When I went to St. Mary's, you know, they have the class...

EB:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

IC:
Okay. And so I went through, and I noticed that, you see, when they gave me this copy, it was already written on their copy. Probably this copy goes back to 2013. And so, well, then when they got some updates that's what they wrote. They wrote Gamboni: dead. Man, I've got to ask Marion.

EB: 0:47:20-0:47:23
I think I'll call Marion tomorrow and find out.

IC: 0:47:25-0:47:30
See, in the very same way, I believe this your brother, is it correct?

EB: 0:47:30-0:47:33
Oh, Jim. Yeah. Oh, yeah, but Jim died a couple of years ago. Yeah, so three years ago.

IC: 0:47:33-0:47:39
So you see how they, when they hear about the news, they updated it. So I think that's what they...

EB: 0:47:39-0:50:59
So who else do they have on there that's in our class?

IC: 0:47:42-0:47:47
May, like... Oh, Don Perano. Don Perano.

EB: 0:47:47-0:47:48
Yeah died here last year, the year before.

IC: 0:47:48-0:48:15
And then Deacon, no so this the next class. There's your class, it's Don Gamboni and then (Don Perrano). Yeah that's the only one that were marked. One thing that will you see, the one where you see the pencil is I sent them letters at the address that is here, and I got it back. It says "impossible to forward."
(I got you.)
So I wrote Bob Sherwood at his address in Nevada City.

EB: 0:48:15-0:51:35
Nevada City, that's right.

IC: 0:48:15-0:48:23
But, you know, when you get it back, that doesn't mean much. He could have moved to a different place like two years ago. There is no forwarding information anymore.

EB: 0:48:23-0:48:24
Well, maybe he passed and nobody knew about it.

IC: 0:48:24-0:48:26
And the same for like Don Stater.

EB: 0:48:27-0:48:27
Stater's gone, I know that.

IC: 0:48:28-0:48:29
Oh, you know that.

EB: 0:48:29-0:48:32
Oh, yeah. He's been gone for 10 or 12 years.

IC: 0:48:32-0:48:34
Oh, okay, so they clearly have not updated.

EB: 0:48:34-0:48:35
Yeah, no, no. That's why it makes me think about Gamboni. Because he was, this is Gamboni here. He was here last summer whenever they come through Sacramento, him and his wife call and we go out to lunch.

IC: 0:48:49-0:48:51
Okay, so it must have happened very recently.

EB: 0:48:51-0:48:55
Yeah, well, last summer they were here and we all went to lunch. They do a lot of traveling.

IC: 0:48:56-0:48:57
Look, mean, let's be clear. This all information that I have. Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe they got confused with somebody else.

EB:
I'm going to find out.

IC:
Yeah, yeah. So just let's, like I don't you know these are very important. I don't want you to call somebody and say "Oh your brother is dead"
and then it turns out that he's totally alive and happily alive. So that's what I know.

EB: 0:49:15-0:49:16
Here's Bob Sherwood here.

IC: 0:49:16-0:49:17
Here it is, yeah.

EB: 0:49:17-0:49:20
Sure, yeah, there's Gamboni.

IC: 0:49:20-0:49:22
Yeah that's the picture that I remember.

EB: 0:49:22-0:49:23
There's Eddie Brennan.

IC: 0:49:23-0:49:23
You're here too, I remember.

EB: 0:49:24-0:49:25
Yeah, I was in here somewhere.

IC: 0:49:25-0:49:28
Here it is. You're the captain. Yeah, look at you!

EB: 0:49:27-0:52:47
This is our team here.

IC: 0:49:28-0:49:31
That's your team, yes.

EB: 0:49:31-0:49:43
Van Skonal was a junior. Junior. Jack Reed was a senior. So, Jim Daly was a junior. And George Miller was the only black guy.

IC: 0:49:43-0:49:44
I was about to say, he looks black.

EB: 0:49:44-0:50:04
Him and his sister were the only two black Americans in the whole school. (Wow.)
So, Al Jacobs, he's gone. There's Don Perrano, of course he died. And this was, oh, what the hell's the name, oh, I forget. This is Tom Auclair.

IC: 0:50:04-0:50:08
Oh, that's Tom Auclair, I see, I see.

EB: 0:50:08-0:50:12
That's Tom Auclair. And I remember his name. I know his name, but I just got the (unintelligible)...

IC: 0:50:12-0:50:24
Unless it appears here. Because they may actually appear here. Because you see they have all the different...

EB: 0:50:24-0:50:31
Oh, Bardini. Richard Bardini. That's Bardini there. That Bardini. Let's see, who... Harrigan? That might be Harrington.

IC: 0:50:31-0:50:33
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

EB: 0:50:33-0:50:37
Lou Harrington. Okay, I remember that. Bevilac was gone.

IC: 0:50:37-0:50:43
And so, Ed, it looks like most of the students were white in the schools, correct?

EB: 0:50:43-0:51:04
Oh yeah, except for George Miller. (Okay.)
But there were a lot of Hispanics.

IC:
There were Hispanics? 
AD:
Oh yeah, a lot. In fact, you know, Hispanics are mostly Catholic. Yeah, that's true. And a lot of Hispanics and Italians sent their kids to St. Mary's, you know, because they were good Catholics. (Sure, sure.)
So, you'll see a lot of Hispanics.

IC: 0:51:04-0:51:14
But there were no Asians. I didn't see any Asians. There were no Asian students. At least I didn't see from looking at them.

EB: 0:51:14-0:51:20
No, I don't remember. I don't remember them, to actually tell you the truth.

IC: 0:51:20-0:51:25
Because I went through all the yearbooks to see who graduated, to look at them. Sometimes it's hard to see but sometimes it's clear.

EB: 0:51:25-0:52:05
And O'Gallo is gone. There's Bill McFaul. I don't know if he told you he lost an arm. (No, no.)
Didn't know that? There's Rich. He, he was a sergeant at arms. Honor society.

IC:
So can I ask you, what's a sergeant at arms?

EB:
Pardon me?

IC: 
What's a sergeant at arms? Well, actually it's just a title. If in a senior class, when you're having a class meeting, if anybody got rowdy, Sergeant of Arms is supposed to take them out and kick them out.

IC: 0:52:05-0:52:07
Tiny little Richard?

EB: 0:52:07-0:52:35
So for Richard it was mostly honorary. In fact, almost in every class a Sergeant of Arms is really just a title. You had to have one.

IC:
So you had to choose one and someone had to be one.

EB:
Oh let's see. Alice López, didn't you say it was Alice López, Lassini, now I believe? Is that the one you said you called or had her telephone number or something?

IC: 0:52:35-0:52:39
No, so I talked to Jo Bertolucci.

EB:
Who?

IC:
Josephine Bertolucci.

EB: 0:52:39-0:52:40
Oh, Josephine?

IC: 0:52:40-0:53:05
Yeah, and so I'm going to meet with her.

EB:
Here's Bernice.

IC:
Bernice.

EB:
That's Bernice.

IC:
It's a little bit tricky here because for women, there they appear with their maiden name, while here they appear, so sometimes I need to cross. So the one that I talked on the phone was, and actually...

EB:
What was her first name?

IC:
So one from your class, it was Lorraine Capra.

EB: 0:53:05-0:53:07
Oh yeah, I know Lorraine.

IC: 0:53:07-0:53:10
Yeah, because now she lives in Wisconsin so we couldn't meet in person.

EB: 0:53:10-0:53:15
No, there's Mary. She's the gal whose house you're going to tomorrow.

IC: 0:53:15-0:53:21
Oh, I see. Because I was wondering, she's the only Mary so I thought this must be...

EB: 0:53:21-0:53:22
Mary Phelan, yeah.

IC: 0:53:22-0:53:29
You know that now she goes with her married name which is like, Briarley?

EB: 0:53:29-0:53:39
Yeah, I forget what it is. Briarley. (Briarley!)
Briarley, yeah, I believe that's what it is. (Okay, then.)
And let's see now. Lorraine Capra. I know she's in here someplace.

IC: 0:53:39-0:53:50
Yeah, I think it was at the very beginning maybe.

EB:
Oh, I see, yeah. They're alphabetical.

IC:
Because sometimes if you're in a show or something. Yeah, let's see. Lorraine, I remember that I saw her, you were here. Yeah, it was Lorraine, close to you.

EB: 0:53:50-0:53:56
Here she is. And there was Eddie Brennan. Eddie's still living in Visalia. I'm surprised he's not on your list.

IC: 0:53:56-0:54:09
No, no, he is. I wrote him but he never got back to me.

EB:
Oh, he never answered you.

IC:
Yeah, so you see, I have, where is it, Ed here, that's the address that I have in Vesalia.

EB: 0:54:09-0:54:10
Which address you have there?

IC: 0:54:10-0:54:23
That's the 1829 South Bardo Street in Visalia. And so that's where I wrote him. And I also sent, there was an email here, so I also sent him an email. The email didn't get back, so the email account seems to be working, but I never heard back from him, so I don't know.

EB: 0:54:23-0:54:32
Maybe he's not doing well. Well, he got married again. I'm not sure whether that's his old address or the new address. Let me go get my...

IC: 0:54:32-0:54:35
Oh, thank you. If you have an updated one, that would be great.

EB: 0:54:35-0:55:27
...telephone, please. Thank you. (Pauses to get phone). No, he still lives on Bardo.

IC: 0:55:27-0:55:34
OK. Uh... Yeah, so it's the 18...

EB:
1829 South? Yeah, South Bardo, yeah. Bardo Street. You want his telephone number?

IC:
Yes.

EB: 0:55:34-0:55:38
Yeah, let's see... 559...

IC:
Yes.

EB:
627...

IC: 0:55:38-0:55:43
Oh, OK. 559-627...

EB:
4266.

IC:
4266.

EB:
Right.

IC:
OK. I'll try to give him a call in case...

EB: 0:55:50-0:55:56
Yeah, he's still around. I get a christmas card from him every year. (Okay okay.)
I got one last Christmas, so unless something's happened between now and then...

IC: 0:55:56-0:56:00
Yeah, I'll give it a try.

EB: 0:56:00-0:56:02
There's the old high school there.

IC: 0:56:02-0:56:23
Yes yes I found actually two historical pictures that are really beautiful. (Oh, good.)
And also I went to see, actually ,they kept it more or less the way it is.

EB:
Well, exactly.

IC:
I mean it's not a high school anymore but.

EB:
It's St. Agnes, it's Catholic Graduate School now.

IC:
They allowed me to go inside to take a look but they said, you know, the structure of the building is the same as it was. And so I got an idea of what it looked like.

EB: 0:56:23-0:56:29
The outside is exactly the same and I didn't think they did much remodeling on the inside.

IC: 0:56:29-0:57:01
I asked for the inside and they said "No, you know, like maybe we change,the shape and the structure but the inside is still the same."
They painted it and so on, but it's basically still the same. So it was interesting to go and see it.

EB:
So anyway...

IC:
Ed, I had one more question and I'll let you free and I know that your wife needs you. But the question is, I know at least for some schools, maybe St. Mary's was different, but I know that for some schools, when you join the school as a freshman, there are certain kind of like, how do you call it, rituals...

EB: 0:57:01-0:57:04
Oh, initiation?

IC:
Initiation, yes.

EB:
Yes, yes. In fact, there was a picture in here of that.

IC: 0:57:04-0:57:06
Oh, okay.

IC:
Was there something like that in St. Mary's?

EB:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

IC: 0:57:07-0:57:10
Can you tell me a little bit about what was the tradition?

EB: 0:57:10-0:57:23
Well, here's what... This was a freshman coming in. During initiation, the seniors made him climb the flagpole. That kind of stuff. (Okay.)
Or they'd make them do stupid things.

IC: 0:57:23-0:57:31
Like, yes, that tradition!

EB:
Crawl, or something like...

IC:
But how did it work? First of all, you had brought them.

EB:
Just for one day.

IC:
Oh, it was only one day?

EB: 0:57:31-0:57:47
Oh yeah. In fact, it was like, if I remember, just during recess for one day, and they just went through an initiation. (That's it.)
It was no big deal like some of the big public schools. It was not an all-day thing or an all-week thing.

IC: 0:57:47-0:57:53
Because larger public schools had a bigger tradition? Like for example, you're thinking like Stockton High or something?

EB: 0:57:53-0:57:57
Yeah, they might have their own. I don't know what they did for initiation over there.

IC: 0:57:57-0:58:03
Did you guys play sports against them?

EB: 0:58:03-0:58:06
Oh yeah, we used to play basketball. Not football, they were in a higher league.

IC:
So they were good at that?

EB:
Oh yeah.

IC: 0:58:06-0:58:15
Well they were also much bigger than you, like Stockton High was a much larger school.

EB: 0:58:15-0:59:00
Oh it was huge, yeah. They probably had a couple thousand kids over there.

IC:
That's what I thought from what I've been able to collect, it was a huge school.

EB:
Yeah, but they had a hell of a football team, and took great athletes to come out of there and went on to college and became great athletes in college. We used to play them in basketball, but not football, because our basketball team was as good as theirs. We never beat them though. The two years I remember playing them, they beat us both years. But I'm trying to think, we were seniors, I was on the basketball team, we played Stockton High there, and we were leading until about the third quarter. So we had a pretty good team in basketball. Then they got hot and wiped us out.

IC: 0:59:00-0:59:16
Still you did well. So, Ed, do you remember if, like, you know, I go back to my memories in high school or even earlier, and it often happens in classrooms that you have, like, the super cool kids, okay?

EB: 0:59:16-0:59:22
Oh yeah, they used to call them the 400s.

IC:
It's called the 400s?

EB:
They used to call them. There was a 400.

IC: 0:59:22-0:59:28
There was a 400?

EB:
Yeah, and there was a couple of them in our class.

IC:
These are the top one, you know, 400 is like...

EB:
Yeah, kind of snob.

IC:
Snob, superstar...

EB: 0:59:28-1:00:28
They lived in the exclusive neighborhoods. Had plenty of money. In fact, I'll point out a couple of them.

IC:
Do you remember which ones?

EB:
There were two that we used to call 400. I don't know if Mary or Bernice would say that, because Mary and Bernice were good regular people. But these gals used to dress...

IC:
In a fancy way?

EB:
Yeah. Nancy Walsworth was one of them.

IC:
She was a 400.

EB:
Well, we thought, a lot of the guys did. I don't really know what the girls thought. All the guys thought they were 400. And her buddy, they were inseparable. Every time you saw one you saw the other. It was Barbara Brisbois I believe her name was. Yes, let's see.

IC:
Barbara Brisbois, you said?

EB:
Brisbois, Barbara Brisbois, B-B-B. Where is she?

IC: 1:00:28-1:00:33
Are you sure she was in the same class? Maybe she was in the class before or after?

EB: 1:00:33-1:01:50
No, no, she was in our class, but I'm just wondering...

IC:
Maybe she left, she moved to...

EB:
Well, I'm just wondering, maybe she did, I don't remember her leaving. I know she was in our junior thing. I thought I had seen a couple of pictures of her in there. (Flipping through pages) Juniors, juniors... 
I could have sworn she was in here, but I guess maybe I'm wrong. Why don't you ask Mary Ann Bernice tomorrow?

IC:
Her name was Barbara?

EB:
Barbara Brisbois. She was a nice looking gal. She was a blonde, beautiful gal. She was always well-dressed. Her and Nancy used to be probably two of the best-dressed girls in school. Other folks had a few bucks here and there.

IC: 1:01:50-1:02:05
What about the other direction? Were there people... Sometimes in class you have these people that capture... Everybody makes fun of them, everybody teases them, or lots of people tease them either because they are, you know...

EB: 1:02:05-1:02:19
Well, Richard... we used to tease Richard Huddleston, but because we liked him, not because he was goofy. But everybody liked him and he was always saying crazy things and he was funny and...

IC:
Uh-huh, like he was a funny guy.

EB:
Yeah, he actually was pretty funny.

IC: 1:02:19-1:02:22
Do you remember if anybody teased Richard Montague?

EB: 1:02:22-1:02:27
No, I don't think so. Not to my knowledge. It may have happened, but I don't ever remember anything like that.

IC: 1:02:27-1:02:54
So you interacted with him. Did you have a sense that Richard, because later in life, lots of people that, not the people that knew him well, but the people that knew him just superficially, they always labeled him as intimidating.

EB:
In what?

IC:
Intimidating.

EB:
Oh, okay. And always wondered wondered how can a man who is 5'6", kind of tiny, but intellectually intimidating. He would talk to you and you would feel like, he's judging me.

EB: 1:02:54-1:03:14
I could see where that would happen in college.

IC:
You can imagine that based on...

EB:
He wasn't like that in high school. You're never intimidated. Never. I mean, you know, he's just a regular guy. He's just smarter than everybody else. That's all. No, he would never intimidate me and I was probably the worst student in that class.

IC: 1:03:14-1:03:16
But he felt comfortable with you.

EB: 1:03:16-1:03:21
Oh, yeah, yeah. He was really a nice guy. He really was.

IC: 1:03:21-1:03:54
Yeah, so, Ed, I mean, this was really, really great because it opened a beautiful window on this world. I told you that basically I know nothing about that time. I mean I know something about his time at Berkeley because I've been able to find a few people. And I definitely know more about his time at UCLA because I know more people, his students from UCLA, many of them are still alive so I was able to interview them. There are some images, some pictures. It's closer to my world and it's closer to our time. (Right.)
But the Stockton time was completely a mystery until I ran into you guys.

EB: 1:03:54-1:03:58
Well, there aren't many of us left. I think there's what, like about 20, did you say, or 22?

IC: 1:03:58-1:04:13
Yeah, this is the list that I found. So basically around 20-something, yes. And then we don't know for some of them.

EB:
And I know Stater's not here, I know that for sure.

IC:
And then I have a couple of letters that got back, so we don't know what that means.

EB: 1:04:13-1:04:28
So it could only be like, I don't know, Don Perano just went, I read where he died last year.

IC:
Yeah, they wrote it here.

EB:
Yeah. I bet there isn't more than 15, 15 or 16 of us around, to tell you the truth.

IC: 1:04:28-1:04:51
And in fact, actually, while I was arranging the trip here, that's why I ended up extending the trip, is because somebody who was in graduate school with Richard, who then became a famous professor at Stanford, his name was Sol Feferman, who I contacted three years ago when I started this project and supported the project beautifully and nicely with suggestions.

EB: 1:04:51-1:04:54
Oh, excuse me, I think that's my daughter.

IC:
Please, please.

EB:
I'll be right back.
