AK: 0:00:00-0:00:37
So the question is why do I make a contribution to the Tarski fund?
I guess a range of things.
So I have enormous intellectual respect for him.
I knew him.
I thought of him as, because Richard was such an important figure in my life, I thought of him as a kind of intellectual grandfather.
Not in the way in which one thinks of the good grandfather, but I thought of myself, I mean, I thought-

AF: 0:00:37-0:00:38
You know yourself in a long-

AK: 0:00:38-0:01:51
A huge amount that I got from Richard came from Tarski.
I read his stuff and I admired his own stuff.
I thought he was a great figure.
I continued to have huge respects for his accomplishments as an academic leader, for creating something that he created in California.
I mean, California was not the intellectual center of the world in 1940.
And Tarski, he made Berkeley the intellectual center of logic in the world, right?
And it filtered out to Southern California and so on.
If it weren't for him, I probably wouldn't be doing logic.
I don't know, what would have happened, right?
I really mean I really see him, you know, not just as the intellectual leader, but as the administrative leader.

AF: 0:01:51-0:02:01
Yeah, right.
Well that's actually why I'm writing, why I think he's interesting to write about, because he was really a seminal figure and he, I mean in the best sense, he built an empire.

AK: 0:02:01-0:02:09
He built an empire in the best sense.
Yeah, that's right.
He built an intellectual empire of incredibly talented people.

AF: 0:02:09-0:02:10
That's still there.

AK: 0:02:10-0:02:11
Yeah, it's still there.

AF: 0:02:11-0:02:27
In Poland, I was in Poland a year ago, and there people trace their lineage.
"I'm a great, great grand."
People do it that way.
(Really?)
His stature there, I think, is as great as anywhere in the world just because that's where he came from.
But I mean it's a real-

AK: 0:02:27-0:02:34
Is it because those are people who came to America to study with him and so on?

AF:
Or who studied with people-

AK:
Or is this before he left?
Or was this-

AF: 0:02:34-0:02:56
Well there are people from before he left who say then studied with Mostowski, who say there was Roszawa who was a Mostowski student and then if you were a student of Roszawa, and then you were a student of a student of Roszawa, so there are people who still trace their...
and people here, in some sense, don't do it in the same way.
We don't have that same...

AK: 0:02:56-0:03:19
I have enormous respect, because I've kind of hung around administrators and done some administration here for a bit.
I have huge respect for these people who build a great and powerful intellectual thing, like build a great university, and pretty much they did it.
These things don't just happen.

AF: 0:03:19-0:03:20
No, you have to have a vision.

AK: 0:03:20-0:03:41
It doesn't happen.
Somebody has to have the vision, but they also have to have the force. Right?
They have to have a huge amount of vitality.
(Yes.) I have to have terrific people skills.
They don't have to be nice, I mean, but one of the great lessons of life is you don't have to be nice and you don't have to be normal to accomplish anything
Right?

But they have to have vitality and energy.
They have to have a kind of brilliance.
They have to have a kind of monomania, you know?
I mean, a desire for, you know, a power or empire.
It doesn't have to be personal power.
I mean, their drive to accomplish this.
They have to see this as of such value, of such importance, that everything else, like family, and you know, so it just gets swept aside, you know, and so on.

And with all that, almost no one can pull it off.
But once in a while, if you hang around universities, you see someone.
I was at a meeting, well, it's just, I wander, right?
I was at a meeting with our chancellor, and it was with, this is something you can't put into your thing, but I don't mind you having it.

AF: 0:04:33-0:04:34
I'll listen to it, yeah.

AK: 0:04:34-0:07:29
It was a meeting with Chicano faculty during a very tense period.
And the fact, the Chicano faculty were complaining to the administration, you know, that "We need to do this, and you're not providing leadership for it, you need this", and so on and so on.

The Chancellor and I, I was chair of the Academic Center at that time, and all the Chicano faculty,

AF:
Who was the Chancellor?

AK:
Chuck Young, who's still Chancellor.

And all of the Chicano faculty on the campus, almost all of them were there, and these were very difficult at times.
And he listened and listened and listened.
And then he finally kind of exploded.
It was very moving.
He was really speaking from the heart.
He said, look, "We've provided a lot of resources to you and we will continue to.
Your program is important, there's no question.
We'll continue to provide resources.
But I want to tell you something about academic leadership.
You know, you feel the chancellor's office and the vice chancellor haven't provided enough.
He said, we can't do it.
You have to do it."
He said, "I've been here for 25 years."
He said, "Every great intellectual center that has been built on this great research campus, he said, has been built by a faculty member."

And then, he started running through, you know, Latin American studies, medieval and renaissance.
These are all the things that people on this campus know.
UCLA is famous for its this and that, right?
And each one of them, he gave us a little detailed thumbnail sketch about how it happened, right?
And some of them, how it happened and it became very famous, and that person died, and so on, and then he had a successor and another one, and we may have to abolish the center now because it's gone, right?
And it was an amazing story to hear.
Not one of these things came from a dean, from a chancellor, and so on.
They all came from a Tarski.
They all came from a Tarski.
Somebody who himself was brilliant, had some kind of people skills that were magnetic.
I mean, he was a charismatic personality, the way that Tarski was.
Could attract people, got them all working, got them working together with one another, gave them a sense of uplift and spiritual accomplishment that they were on the great, they were doing the great work.
Yeah, and that every, of course everything else should be put aside, you know, you know for this, was able to communicate that kind of fanatical-The Crusaders, you know, you see the Crusaders off on the for the Holy Grail, you know.
And so, and he went through and every one of them was a case like that.
Okay, but it isn't as if there are 50 of them on this campus, right?
There were four or five and so on.
And Tarski was one of those people.
One of those people, no question.

AF:
I have incredible respect for that.

AK:
Yeah.
And it just, it's really something just absolutely amazing.

AF: 0:07:29-0:07:33
So you wanted to acknowledge that?

AK: 0:07:33-0:08:47
I wanted to.
Tarski, in my view, Tarski is a great man.
I mean, he may not have been a nice man, and he may have had all kinds of other faults, but he was great in what he accomplished.
And what he accomplished was good, was something of very high value.
I suppose that Attila the Hun and so on was probably a great military leader also.
There are great figures who have all the same powers and all of those same things, but they put them to evil ends.
Or, you know. And Tarski put it to the promulgation and development of the things that I still think of as, you know, I mean, it's the highest of human endeavor, right?
You know, I mean, this is, you know, when we're all angels, right?
We'll all be, when we're all angels, we'll all be in Tarsi's class doing these precise proofs of theorems, right?
I mean, that's what heaven will be like, you know, when we're when all the earthly imperfections are removed.

AF: 0:08:47-0:08:51
I want you to tell me as much as you can about Tarski and Carnap.

AK: 0:08:51-0:09:01
Nothing at all.

AF:
Carnap came when?

AK:
Reichenbach died and Carnap was Reichenbach's replacement, then it was a couple of years later.

AF: 0:09:01-0:09:12
Yeah.
And, well, there's some story about Tarski saying, giving a speech at Carnap's memorial that had to do with Carnap's generosity and niceness.
Do you know?

AK: 0:09:12-0:09:43
I was one of the organizers of the memorial and I should and I just don't remember it.

AF:
Okay, because I have a story and I just want to hear if it-

AK:
But Tarski was a great, Tarski was a, Carnap was a great man also.
Tarski was a great, Tarski was a, Carnap was a great man also.
And for me, I mean, Carnap also, no doubt, Carnap had his own monomania and family and others and Ina and people in some way, although they were very connected to one another, must have suffered in some way for that.
I mean, she gave her life over to him.

AF: 0:09:43-0:09:46
That was his name, her name Ina?

AK: 0:09:46-0:09:47
Ina.

AF: 0:09:47-0:09:50
Oh, because Tarski's daughter is Ina, but short for Christina.

AK: 0:09:50-0:10:13
I don't know what Ina's name was short for.
But I love Carnap.

And Rene and I and Ina and Carnap were all very, very close.
(Yeah.)
And Carnap was, at least with us and the independence movement, he was the most non-exploitative of people.
He was really a good...
He was a very good person.

AF: 0:10:13-0:10:32
Yeah.
Well, in essence, the remarks that Tarski made at Carnap's memorial were an acknowledgment of this and by implication, saying he was a far greater man than I in terms of his work.
But you don't remember that.

AK: 0:10:32-0:10:34
I don't remember it.
But he was a great person.

AF: 0:10:34-0:10:36
What I just said doesn't refresh your memory,
as we say on the O.J. Simpson-?

AK: 0:10:36-0:10:40
Yeah.
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that it doesn't.

AF: 0:10:40-0:10:44
Because I do, as I collect material, I love getting the same story from several people.

AK: 0:10:44-0:13:00
You know, Carnap is famous for the so-called "principle of tolerance", right?
Which really is, you know, "construct your object language any way you want, but use a nominalistic metal language or something like that", right?
But there was a kind of principle of tolerance that was generally in Carnap.

And I remember Carnap saying to me with great passion and, with a kind of religious passion, that he thought every human being had the absolute moral obligation to develop whatever their own intellectual capacities were to the highest level that they could develop their own.
So this one should develop in this way, and this one in this way, and this one who has more capacity should go further.
But it's just as valuable that this person develops their own capacity to this level as better than this one who could be up here but is lazy and has only gone to this level.
There was a great kind of warmth and egalitarianism, and socialism, and generosity.

I remember he kind of subscribed to...
Who's the guy who used to...
radical political writer?


AF:
 Irving Stone, weekly.

AK:

No, it's not Irving Stone.
I.F. Stone.
He subscribed to I.F. Stone for me for a couple of years until it took and I started doing it on my own.
And he was always interested in socialism and he had his library with all the books on, not just Esperanto.
Did you know that it was like a half a dozen different constructed languages that were constructed by these?
And the other thing about it that was interesting that I didn't realize is all the people who made these languages, they were all one-worldists.
These languages were all constructed because of the ideology that we were...
Not that it would be useful to have it.
It was constructed out of a passionate political, not a technocratic idea, but it's political.
We should be one world, we're all citizens of the world, we should...
Tarski, he kind of was very much into that kind of thing.

He was a good person.
He really was.

AF: 0:13:00-0:13:10
Do you have the same admiration for him as an intellectual?

AK: 0:13:10-0:13:12
Yes, I do.

AF: 0:13:12-0:13:14
Do you put him on equal footing with Tarski?

AK: 0:13:14-0:13:33
I do, yeah.
It wasn't the same-
He had a different kind of mind.
I surely got a lot more from Carnap than if I had been Tarski's student.
It was just right for me to be Richard's student.
We were closer in age and so on.
I didn't get any of the bad stuff.

AF: 0:13:33-0:13:37
Who did you get your PhD from?
Richard or Carnap?

AK: 0:13:37-0:13:46
Carnap.
Richard was on my PhD committee.
Actually, Richard in many ways worked more closely with me in the actual writing of the dissertation and so on.

AF: 0:13:46-0:13:50
He wasn't that much older than you, Richard, but you don't know exactly how much.

AK: 0:13:50-0:18:30
He's a lot smarter, though.
My sense of Carnap in the seminars was, he gave these wonderful seminars that every question that any of us smart-alec, we thought we were very smart kids, any question that any of us could ask him, and we would raise our hand and ask, that this is a question that had been asked him so many times before that he, not that this is true, but this is the sense that was conveyed.
That he knew exactly, first of all, he was sweet and appreciative of the question.
Then he fixed the question.
You know, "Oh, it's got a little, this needs to be filed down, and you need to add a little something here to make it a perfect, to perfect the question, right?"
And then he gave an answer as if he'd spent a year writing a book on this.

AF:
Thinking just this question.

AK:
Yeah, and you got this perfect answer.
Now sometimes you could argue with him about it and you disagreed and all the rest of it, but such a sense of magisterial mastery.

I'll tell you one other story about Carnap.
I actually wrote up someplace in a little memorial.
I proved a theorem that showed that the last, his sort of last attempt at the verifiability criterion of meaning, how you show that theoretical concepts have empirical meaning by connecting them through a string of theory to observational concepts and so on.
He developed some highly technical apparatus to do this.
I proved this theorem that in a certain sense trivialized it.
It showed that if you had a physical theory and you had a purely metaphysical theory over here, it was completely isolated.
You could put the two of them together and the whole metaphysical theory suddenly becomes empirically meaningful, which was not supposed to happen.

But in order to do that, I had to take a few steps that Carnap had not exactly written, but they seemed to be in the spirit of what he was doing.
So I had this result.
Richard had encouraged me.
I had done some other results related and Richard had said, "You know, you ought to try using that technique on Carnap's thing."
And I played around with it and I was able to do it.
So I took this stuff to Carnap, you know, and I had dropped it off and he had looked at it and he said he wanted me to come up and talk to him, you know.
So I was going to say, "You know, look, I'm aware of the fact that this is not right, you're, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
And he just greeted me, hugged me, he said, "This is wonderful."
He said, "This is just wonderful."
I said, well, you know, there's [unintelligible], that doesn't matter.
That's what I was-

Basically, he says, "This is so wonderful."
"What do you like about it?"
He had been working on this problem for 30 years of his life, trying to achieve a certain result.
And now he saw it couldn't be done!


AF:
It couldn't be done.

AK:
It couldn't be done.
I mean, not that I really definitively proved it couldn't be done.
But this was sort of the last straw.
And the method was powerful enough that he could see that he could, if he tried this or that, he could try an epicycle, I'd try an epicycle, you know, we could play this game sort of back and forth.
He says, "It couldn't be done."
And he said, "You know, Peter Hample has been saying to me for a long time, 'You know, you're never gonna do it this way.
You're gonna have to treat theories holistically and you're not gonna be able to separate that kind of metaphysical part from the empirical part.
It can't be done', right?"
He said, "He was right, he was right.
This is wonderful, this is your best work, I really love this."

He said, "Now I've got this new idea.
Use the epsilon operator, you take the theory as a whole.
You apply the epsilon..." and off he was.
Just the whole idea was, no, that whole strand abandoned and tried to do it now in a completely different way.
He was so delighted.
And this sense was so strong of...

Now this is something that I should say about Tarski also, but from a very remote point of view.
Carnap was interested in certain problems.
He wanted to know what the solutions were to those problems.
He was not interested in Carnap's solution to the problem.
He was interested in the solution to the problem.
He wanted the science to be advanced.
He didn't care whether he did it or someone else did it.
He didn't care whether it happened according to the ideas that he had put forward or whether the track he'd been working on was completely wrong and it went in another direction.
It was an egolessness to him.

AF: 0:18:30-0:18:32
That's really different from Tarski.

AK: 0:18:32-0:18:46
Well now, this is something that I...
I want to tell you one story about Tarski that I think is interesting that also left a very profound effect on me.
It was the last talk I heard him give.
He must have been retired already.

AF: 0:18:46-0:18:55
He retired and came here in 60...
He retired in...
Well, I think he had to retire when he was 67 or 66.

AK: 0:18:55-0:18:56
Or something like that, because there were rules.

AF: 0:18:56-0:19:01
And then he came down here for a year, though.
I think his last year after he retired, he was some sort of extraordinary professor.

AK: 0:19:01-0:19:03
Something like that.

AF: 0:19:03-0:19:08
And then he was 67.
So he was here...
It was a logic year here or something, and he was here for a good part of that.
Something like that.
So he was here.

AK: 0:19:08-0:19:09
And when did he die?

AF: 0:19:09-0:19:12
He died in 83.
So he lived on-

AK: 0:19:12-0:19:20
Okay, no, no, it was way after that.

AF:
Way after that.

AK:
This was way after that.
It was the last talk he gave at UCLA.
And he came down from up north.

AF: 0:19:20-0:19:24
Okay.
But you don't have a date in your mind for when-

AK: 0:19:24-0:19:30
I don't, but you know, Don or maybe C.C.
Have you talked to him?

AF:
Not yet, but I'll go to see.

AK: 0:19:30-0:19:37
You're going to talk to C.C.?

AF:
Yeah.
Do you have an address or anything for her?
Most people don't.
I think he'll talk to her.

AK: 0:19:37-0:19:38
I'll bet...

AF: 0:19:38-0:19:40
I'll bet you he'll talk to her.

AK: 0:19:40-0:19:48
Oh, I'm sure he will.
Yeah.
But maybe Tony Martin would, you know, or Herb Enderton, or, you know, one of those people.

AF: 0:19:48-0:19:53
Yeah, well, Giannis, for example, doesn't have an address.

AK:
Who?

AF:
Giannis does not have an address for C. C.

AK: 0:19:53-0:19:54
He doesn't?

AF: 0:19:54-0:20:04
Well, he says the department will have one.
(Yeah.)
It's very much, he's in Shangri-La, as people say.
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
But he's ten miles from here.
Shangri-La is ten miles from here.

AK: 0:20:04-0:20:11
Yeah, you know, I mean, he's in the retirement system.
Right?


AF:
I know.

AK:
Because he's University of California.
Yeah.
So, some place at the University of California, they have an address.

AF: 0:20:11-0:20:15
I'll find him.

AK:
Right.

AF:
I'll find him.
It's just I'm not doing it this time.

AK: 0:20:15-0:20:26
Okay.
Anyway.
So, last talk.
I don't know when it was.
It was the last talk he gave at UCLA, and it was late in life, well after he had retired.

AF: 0:20:26-0:20:33
Did you go to his 70th birthday thing in Berkeley?
That big thing?

AK: 0:20:33-0:20:34
I did.

AF: 0:20:34-0:20:38
I think there's a picture of you there.

AK: 0:20:38-0:20:58
I think I gave a paper.

AF:
Yeah, right.

AK:
I think I must have given a paper there.
I think that was an occasion when he was very kind to me.
And I think he, my sense was that he controlled who was going to be allowed to talk at his party.
And that's one of the, now you have refreshed my memory.
And that was one of the things that I felt a very-

AF: 0:20:58-0:21:00
You felt honored to have been-

AK: 0:21:00-0:21:16
I felt honored because I thought I was probably the least deserving person that managed to get onto that list.


AF:
Nonsense!

AK:
But I did not have that sense of myself.
I was still pretty, I guess I was relatively younger.


AF:
Well, it was 1970.

AK:
Well, I wasn't.

AF: 0:21:16-0:21:17
71.

AK: 0:21:17-0:21:23
How old was I?


AF:
1971.

AK:
I was in my 30s.


AF:
You haven't forgotten how old you were when you were born?

AK:
I was in my 30s.

AF:
Okay, anyway.
So, last time you saw him-

AK:
So, I was 37 years old.

AF: 0:21:23-0:21:26
Yeah, yeah.

AK: 0:21:26-0:22:47
Anyway, and he was nice to me.
I had the feeling that he had invited me.


AF:
Surely, surely he did.

AK:
Or played a role, and I felt quite honored to do it.
Anyway, so he came down and he gave this talk.
He started out by saying, he says, "I hope you'll allow me to do this" or "Forgive me," or something, for doing this,
He said, "But I'm not going to talk about work of my own.
I don't have work of my own that I'm interested, you know, that's..."
Whatever.
"I'm gonna talk about someone else's work."
And I'm going to give you a talk about-", I can't remember who it was though, about work that somebody else had done.
And then he gave a Tarski talk, one of these beautifully crafted, from the ground up, explaining and laying it all out talk.
And it was all someone else's work!

AF:
And you don't remember who it was?

AK:
I don't remember who it was.
But I thought to myself at that point, now maybe Tarski in fact was egomaniacal and had to get credit for everything.
And I do remember sort of hearing stories that people would do something and he would say, "Well, I did that years ago, but the manuscript was burned in the basement of the, you know-"

AF: 0:22:47-0:22:48
Or "I thought of it."

AK: 0:22:48-0:24:43
"I thought of it."
Yeah.
But I thought to me, that was a Carnap-like, yeah, that was a Carnap-like gesture.
I mean, here he was.
(Yeah.) It's instead of trying to kind of bluff his way through some result.
I mean, he knew first rate work and what was not first rate work.
He wasn't a phony.


AF:
Oh, he certainly wasn't a phony.
No, no question.

AK:
I heard Karl Popper give talks.
He was disgusting.
I've heard other people as they get older, great figures, give talks, and they've sort of lost their judgment in some way.
And they've become inflated with their own magnificence and all the rest of this.

I know he wasn't a humble person, but there's a kind of powerful humility and a kind of sense of respect for quality in a person who would come down and give a talk on another person's work.

And he didn't say, "And I proved this theorem, you know, it's fundamentally his work, but I proved this and I proved that."
That's not what he was doing!
He was teaching.
He came to teach.
I guess in a way that's another thing that just, he was such a fantastic teacher.
You know, I could understand how, I mean, I could understand how it would be scary to be in his class, and so on, but if you could just be a fly in the wall, everything was so perfectly explained.
I thought there was a kind of intellectual and moral, in a sense, of the investment, his investment in his discipline.
A kind of moral sainthood, you know, coming down.

AF:
A moral sainthood?

AK:
You know, I mean.

AF:
That's beautiful.

AK:
I mean, but not as a, not human ethics and morality, but you know, it's the morality of dedication, that Carnapian thing, I think, of dedication to his discipline.
For somebody to give a big talk and to be a very, very famous person and to be the founder and the creator and so on.

AF:
That's the first time I've heard that.

AK:
And to talk about somebody else's work.

AF:
That is very interesting.

AK:
Yeah, it was wonderful.
It was wonderful.

And that's sort of my closing,
that's sort of my closing.
I mean, he was older by that time.
Maybe his wife had died already.

AF: 0:25:37-0:25:39
No, no, his wife.
He pre-deceased his wife.

AK: 0:25:39-0:26:02
He pre-deceased her, right.
Yeah, right.
I don't remember whether there were young women hanging on him anymore at that age.
He looked older.

That was sort of my closing memory of him.
I like it.
It makes me feel good.
This is one of the things I feel I'd like to be...

AF: 0:26:02-0:26:12
You're kind of contradicting yourself though, because you began by saying he was a bad guy.
You really didn't like him, and then you sort of moved to this final image.

AK: 0:26:12-0:26:20
I didn't like him as a human.

AF:
As Richard's mentor.

AK:
No, as a human, in terms of human interaction.

AF: 0:26:20-0:26:21
Right, yeah.

AK: 0:26:21-0:27:00
But there are some people who are sleazy disciplinarians, if I can put it that way.
They may be saintly people, give away their clothes to beggars and things like that, but professionally, they're a little bit on the sleazy side.

He was professionally a kind of moral saint.
In that, constant dedication to the highest values, this thing, and holding that up.
That's what I mean.
I didn't think he was any better a human being.

AF:
It'd be cocky.

AK:
Right.

AF: 0:27:00-0:27:15
He wasn't a bad human being at certain points.
There were a lot of things he did for people that were very, very generous and very good.
I want you...
I'm not gonna detail them for you, but there were.
In other words, everybody has their...

AK: 0:27:15-0:27:20
Well, I always think that people like that, especially a person like Tarski...

AF: 0:27:20-0:27:27
He did a lot of very, very generous personal things for people, which are surprising to me.

AK: 0:27:27-0:28:05
It is.
That does not surprise me, because I think that people like that who are very powerful and who are very capable and who have the ability to create something like that and can move people around and move things around and so on, I think those, and they live in refined circles.
I think they know they're exploiting people and they know that they're behaving badly.
And I think many of them (like opportunities to-) like opportunities to make it up in a kind of, to do a good, to do a generous good.

AF: 0:28:05-0:29:02
The sorts of things he did were things that he could have taken different moral positions on and not do.
He encouraged a lot of people to buy houses and to help people personally when they came.
He was instrumental in [Milos, ???, 28:20] getting his appointment at Berkeley and things like that.
That's one kind of thing.

But he went out of his way, in personal ways, say for Bob Bott, when Bob Bott was sick, he did just tremendous amounts of things to him.
And he went to bat for Richard when Richard got involved in homosexual trouble in Berkeley.
And yeah, he was willing to go to court for him.

So there were those kinds of things that Tarski might not have chosen to get himself involved in.
And those are things that more surprised me, because there were certain moral things.
Well, if somebody is mentally off, then I'll stay away.
Or if somebody's deviant, I'll stay away.
That's more what I'm talking about.

AK: 0:29:02-0:29:32
He was very, very closely and intimately connected to those people.
I mean, they weren't just colleagues that saw one another at night.

AF:
No, they were students.

AK:
They were his people, right?
And he was in a very intense relationship with them. (Sure.) And it might have been, you know, I have to go.
It might have been a kind of domineering sort of relationship.


AF:
No, but it was caring.
It was caring.

AK:
It's like the way you're connected to your children.
Even bad parents are connected to their children.

AF: 0:29:32-0:29:36
He wasn't a good parent to his children, but he was a good parent to some of his students.

AK: 0:29:36-0:29:53
To some of these people, whom he had more respect for, probably, in some ways.

Anyway, I liked having that sort of image-

AF:
That's a nice one.

AK:
-you know, to kind of walk away from, of him and his connection to this discipline that he so much created in a social way.

AF: 0:29:53-0:30:01
I like it a lot because I haven't heard it before.
(Yeah.)
So it's a...
Listen, you're the Reichenbach chair or something like that?

AK: 0:30:01-0:30:05
Yeah, I am now, yeah.
(And is...)
I'm the Hans Reichenbach professor of philosophy.

AF: 0:30:05-0:30:12
And is Mrs. Reichenbach still alive?

AK:
She is.

AF:
And is she compos mentis?
Is she ever?

AK: 0:30:12-0:30:27
That, you know, yes, you bet!

AF:
Alright, because she knew Tarski in the...

AK:
Right, on top of it, she lives in Pacific Palisades.
Maria Reichenbach.

AF:
Okay, do you have a number for her?

AK:
I don't have it on my person, but I definitely have it at home, but I'll bet she's in the phone book.

AF: 0:30:27-0:30:28
So you think she's in there?

AK: 0:30:28-0:30:37
She has a very lively intellect.
She's filled with stories.


AF:
That's what I want.

AK:
She is absolutely perfect, and she remembers, as far as I can tell, she remembers everything that's ever happened to her.

AF: 0:30:37-0:30:40
How old is she now, in the 80s or more, I think?

AK: 0:30:40-0:30:46
She doesn't look that old to me.
(Okay.)
She's probably in her 70s.
(Okay.)
She's kind of a bird-like little woman.

AF: 0:30:46-0:30:49
Okay. So she lives in Pacific Palisades?
(Yeah.)
Do you think she's in the...

AK: 0:30:49-0:30:53
Yes, I think she's in the book, and if she's not, phone me at home and I'll give you her
number.

AF: 0:30:53-0:30:59
Great.
Again, I won't get to her this time, but she should be a very good...

AK: 0:30:59-0:31:02
She's a wonderful person.
She's a philosopher.
She taught philosophy.

AF: 0:31:02-0:31:08
Yeah, right.
Well, people used to kind of make fun of him now, right, is that fair?

AK: 0:31:08-0:31:17
Uh, I have to go.

AF:
Okay, where's another time?

AK:
Uh, I don't know how they...
I don't know, you know, I mean...
