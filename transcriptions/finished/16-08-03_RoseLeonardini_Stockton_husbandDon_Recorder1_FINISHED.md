DL:
You being recorded? 

IC: 0:00:00-0:00:27
Yes, last night. 

RL
You can eat while I go through the answers that I have here. 

IC:
No, no, no, I can eat later. Thank you very much. And I have also... Let me see. Okay. I think they're both working. I have my own coffee. And I also, well, first, I brought a little thing to say thank you to you guys. 

RL:
Oh, you don't have to do that. You don't have to do that. 

IC:
It's some chocolate from San Diego. 

RL: 0:00:27-0:00:30
Oh, I love chocolate. Thank you. 

IC: 0:00:30-0:00:37
And they also, they're packed in, each of them is packed separately, so that you're not going to be tempted. You can eat one at a time. 

RL: 0:00:37-0:00:38
You can eat one right now. 

RL: 0:00:38-0:00:41
I'm a chocoholic. Thank you. Perfect. 

RL: 0:00:41-0:00:50
Well, see, this is where we're heading. 

IC:
You guys are going to Rome? 

RL:
August 24th. 

IC:
Yeah, fantastic. 

RL:
We go to Rome. 

IC:
So jealous. 

DL:
For five weeks. 

RL:
Five weeks. 

IC: 0:00:50-0:00:51
Nice. 

RL: 0:00:51-0:01:01
But not all in Rome. Then, we're going to stay overnight. 

IC:
Yes. 

RL:
We'll go with my son and his wife. Then we go, and my brother lives there, he's going to meet us. (Oh!)
We go to, my grandparents are from Gugnano. 

IC: 0:01:01-0:01:03
Nice, you're going there? 

RL: 0:01:03-0:01:20
Yes, for two days. Nice. And Naples, we'll see Naples. Then we're going to come back up to Lucca. (Uh-huh.)
Spend a couple of days there. And then my son has a house in Pallarone. You know where that is? 

IC:
No, what is that? 

RL:
It's near Pisa, near Genoa. 

DL:
30 miles. 30 miles. IC: 0:01:20-0:01:23
Along the coast or the mountain? 

RL: 0:01:23-0:01:25
I don't think, I think it's in the inside. 

DL: 0:01:25-0:01:32
We're about 30 miles from Genoa, which is my roots. I'm a Genovese. 

IC:
Oh, you're from Genoa? 

RL: 0:01:32-0:01:38
He's Genoese. 

DL:
I'm Genovese. And we're from the south. My parents, my mother was born there, but she came here when she was only one year old. 

IC: 0:01:38-0:01:44
Wow. 

RL:
But we're all glad she did. 

IC:
So is this the first time you've been to one of those places? 

RL: 0:01:44-0:01:49
No, no. My son was married in Italy in 2008, I think it was. 

IC: 0:01:49-0:01:50
And he moved there? 

RL: 0:01:50-0:01:54
No. He lives here, but he goes there all the time. 

IC:
I see. 

RL:
He's a citizen now and everything. 

IC: 0:01:54-0:01:56
And you said you also have a brother that lives in Italy? 

RL: 0:01:56-0:02:03
My brother has lived in Italy for about 22 years in Netuno. 

IC:
Your family? Oh, Netuno. 

RL:
Netuno, yeah. 

IC: 0:02:03-0:02:04
Not too far from Rome, I know. 

RL: 0:02:04-0:02:11
Yes, yeah. He's very... he goes to Rome all the time. Open this up for me if you can. Oh, you want me to open it? Yeah, I was going to try it. 

IC: 0:02:11-0:02:53
Sometimes it's a little bit tricky. 

RL:
Ah, grazie, grazie. 

DL:
I want to make you laugh before you start. 

IC:
Sorry? 

DL:
I want to make you laugh. 

IC:
Please, please, please. 

DL:
My son and his wife, I said, "Why did you buy a place in Pallerone?"
He said, he's like me, he doesn't like a lot of people. He said, "It's very small. We walk wherever we want to go, we walk."
So I said, well how small is it? He said, "Dad, the city limit signs are back to back."

[Laughs]

IC:
Well, it's going to be a huge difference. 

RL:
Oh yeah, that's where we go to rest. 
IC:
That's a fantastic place. And actually, it's also, I mean, you're going to find... I was a little bit worried that you'd be in an area that is too hot, but that area, even in the summer, I think it's cool enough. 

RL: 0:02:53-0:02:55
Oh, I hope so. I hope so. 

IC: 0:02:55-0:03:03
Especially if they're a little bit on the hilly side. Yeah, because Italy... Actually, I talked to my parents, and they told me that the summer has not been too hot. 

RL: 0:03:03-0:03:06
That's what my brother said. I just talked to him Sunday. 

IC: 0:03:06-0:03:14
Last year was really, really hot. But they keep having rain and so it alternates and then it gets nicely sunny but, you know, breezy. 

RL: 0:03:14-0:03:17
No, he said he hasn't even used his fan that he has in the house. 

IC: 0:03:17-0:03:21
Perfect. That's fantastic. I'm so jealous. 

RL: 0:03:21-0:03:22
Looking forward. 

IC: 0:03:22-0:03:38
I was thinking of going back to Italy in September, but I'm going to postpone now because I'm working on the book and then class starts. But what I've been doing is that I'm gonna go back in December earlier. So as soon as classes are over at the beginning of December, I leave and I spend one month there. 

RL: 0:03:38-0:03:39
One month, good. 

IC: 0:03:39-0:03:44
I haven't seen my family for almost one year. By December it's gonna be one year. And I wanna see them. 

RL: 0:03:44-0:03:46
You gotta go at least once a year, Ivano. 

IC: 0:03:46-0:04:11
And then we've already planned next summer in August my parents are celebrating their 50th anniversary and they're coming

RL:
Oh they're coming here? 

IC:
So they live near Milan (near Milan) although originally they are from Salerno which is south of Naples (yeah) but when they got married they moved to Milan to find a better job, so my brother and I were born in Milan. 

RL:
In Milan. 

IC:
And,-can I help you? I see that... I know they're tricky. 

RL: 0:04:11-0:04:13
They're hard, but they're good, this is good. 

IC: 0:04:13-0:04:34
At home you can just get scissors, but yeah, they are tricky. 

DL:
Oh, thanks. 

IC:
You're welcome. 

And so, I grew up, my brother and I grew up in Milan, but all the summers, when we were kids, we went back to the south with my grandparents because my parents were working and there was no, you know, there was no childcare at that time. And so I know both and the south is so amazing and exciting. 

RL: 0:04:34-0:04:37
I've never been to the south. 

IC: 0:04:37-0:04:40
That's true. I'm so anxious. Be careful a little bit because it can get hot. 

RL: 0:04:40-0:04:41
Very hot, yeah. 

IC: 0:04:41-0:04:46
Hopefully, you know. 

RL:
I've got to pack accordingly. 

DL:
Our son was married when, September 13th? 

RL: 0:04:46-0:04:50
September 13th, 2009. He was married up in Volterra. 

IC: 0:04:50-0:04:55
Oh, okay. Volterra is nicely hot. 

RL:
And we're going to go there too. 

IC:
Oh, Volterra is so beautiful. 

RL: 0:04:55-0:04:58
Isn't it nice there? Such an old, old town. 

IC: 0:04:58-0:05:00
That's one of the parts of Italy that I like the most. 
RL: 0:05:00-0:05:02
All that beautiful stuff they make there. 

IC: 0:05:02-0:05:13
Yes, yes. 

RL:
Alabaster. 

IC:
You know, when they were still building these little towns on top of the hills, so that they would be protected. And these days it means they are quieter, they don't get too big, they are cool. 

RL: 0:05:13-0:05:14
Oh, nice. 

IC: 0:05:14-0:06:06
That's good. I'm so jealous, guys. (Yeah.)

So I got my own copy of the question. 

RL:
Okay, I brought mine. 

IC:
So I can follow you. And also, one thing that I brought in, I have a some printout of the pictures that I found on the yearbooks. Later I have some questions because you can help me with a couple of questions. Okay. Like the choir and so on. Alright. 

Okay, so wherever you want to start from. 

RL:
Alright, I'll start with issue one. 

IC:
Perfect. And by the way, I have a copy of the transcripts in case you... 

RL:
Yeah, you managed to get that, huh? 

IC:
Yeah, because the way I did it is that I found a relative. He's a faraway relative, but he's the only living relative, and he gets the royalties from Montague's book. 

RL:
No kidding! 

IC:
Because, you know, the family, now that I reconstructed the family, unfortunately, it's one of those families that progressively have fewer and fewer kids. 

RL: 0:06:06-0:06:07
Parents are gone. 

IC: 0:06:07-0:06:41
Yeah, and Richard was an only child. The parents had him when they were already old. Actually, maybe you guys can tell me. So in 1930, if you were a couple that had been married for 15 years, so the mother was 36 and the father was 40. They had their first child. That was not like these days, do you agree? Like I mean usually couples tend to, at that time, they tended to have children early on. 

RL:
Yes, they married late maybe. 

IC:
Yeah, no actually I checked, they married in 1915. 

RL: 0:06:41-0:06:46
Wow, why did they wait so long to have... See I was born in 31, so he had to be born

IC: 0:06:46-0:07:06
around 30. Yes, Richard was born in 1930. 1930. I found the birth certificate. Okay. But I also found the marriage certificate of the parents, and they got married in 1915. 

RL:
Why did they wait 15 years? My goodness. 

IC:
I don't know. I mean, like, I don't know. What I know is that within her family, there were not many children. So I don't know if they were, they were all sisters and they had very few children. 

RL: 0:07:06-0:07:08
I'll bet you Richard was an accident! 

IC: 0:07:08-0:07:11
I wonder, I mean, I don't know. 

RL: 0:07:11-0:07:12
They probably didn't plan to have any. 

IC: 0:07:12-0:07:27
Yes, probably, I don't know. On the other hand, I know that the mother was very protective and caring. And I know for sure that he was born, I found the birth certificate, and he was born at the hospital. So he was not even at home. Actually, do you have a sense of how common it was to go... 

RL: 0:07:27-0:07:30
There were only two hospitals in Stockton, St. Joseph's and Damrock. 

IC: 0:07:30-0:07:39
It was the Catholic one, St. Joseph's. 

RL:
St. Joseph's, okay. Was it common, Rose, do you have a sense if it was common for women in 1930 to give birth at an hospital? 

RL: 0:07:39-0:07:54
I was born in a house. He was born in a hospital. I was in Brooklyn. 

IC:
Okay, and you were? 

DL:
Born and raised right here. 

RL:
Were you born in St. Joseph's? 

DL:
I have no idea. 

RL:
You don't know? 

DL:
I can't remember. 

IC:
But don't you remember? 

DL:
I was Caesarian, I know that. 

RL:
Okay. Then it had to be St. Joseph's. 

DL:
It had to be St. Joseph's. 

IC: 0:07:54-0:09:08
I know for sure that in the case of Richard's mother, it was not Caesarian. 

RL:
Okay, natural birth. 

IC:
Because the birth certificate specifies it was natural. Otherwise they would say, they even mentioned the kind of thing that-

RL:
So was she 30 when she got married, do you say? 

IC:
She was, no, she was, uh, okay, when she got married she was born, like, 1894. She was, she was 21. 

RL:
31? 

IC:
21. 

RL:
Oh, 21. And so she had the baby 15 years later. 

IC:
At 36. She was 36. 

RL:
Wow. 

IC:
And the father was 40 when they had the baby. But they had been married for 15 years. So that sounds a little bit strange. You know, of course things are always possible. 

RL:
But yeah, but that is strange. 

IC:
And I know for sure that, you know, I got a little suspicious. I thought, well, maybe they adopted him. But no, the birth certificate clearly says that she was, is the biological mother. 

RL:
She's the mother. 

IC:
The doctor signed the certificate all after the given birth. And then I found a picture of her and comparing Richard's pictures with her that you can totally see. So she's the biological mother. 

RL:
She's the mother. 

IC:
I don't know about the father. [Laughter]
So we don't know. 

DL:
22nd of August, this month, 22nd? 

RL:
22nd. 

DL:
We will be celebrating 62nd. 

RL: 0:09:08-0:09:10
62 years. 

DL:
We've been married 62 years. 

IC: 0:09:10-0:09:16
Congratulations. You guys were going to be in Italy at that time, is that correct? 

RL: 0:09:16-0:09:18
No, we leave on the 24th. Two days later. 

IC: 0:09:18-0:09:20
So you celebrate here and you continue to celebrate there. 

DL: 0:09:20-0:09:22
Do you feel sorry for me? 

IC: 0:09:22-0:09:29
No. I'm so jealous. Totally jealous. Not sorry. Jealous. 

RL: 0:09:29-0:10:03
All right. I'm going to start with this Otis. First of all, the Otis was an IQ test, which you know we cannot give anymore. Yes. It's considered not politically correct to give IQ tests. You give achievement tests, but you don't give IQs. 

IC:
Okay, so it's no longer allowed in schools? 

RL:
Yeah, we no longer give that. But I was testing director at St. Mary's for over 20 years, so I know every test has a number or a letter after it just to distinguish it, just to say what test it is. So that's what that S must mean. 

IC: 0:10:03-0:10:05
So that's what it is, you see? 

RL: 0:10:05-0:10:10
Class S right and it was given there right? 

IC:
Yes. And he had a 127 in those days that was high. 

IC: 0:10:10-0:10:15
I know, still these days by the way, from what I've seen. 

RL: 0:10:15-0:10:19
Because in the Otis test that's high, that's a high IQ. 

IC:
Is it a high IQ? 

RL:
Yes. 

IC: 0:10:19-0:10:26
Okay so good to know actually. 

RL:
I think mine was like 114 and 115 so he was high. 

IC:
You were a super smart one. 

RL: 0:10:26-0:10:47
Yeah, well I know. I mean I wasn't too dumb. Okay, so that's what that S was. It's just the the kind, the version of the test. 

IC:
The kind of test. 

RLL
Yeah, no longer given and I do not know what EQ means. 

IC:
Yeah, you see EQ-

RL:
IQ is intelligence quotient. What could EQ mean? 

IC:
EQ and then he had another number. 

RL:
Oh, he had another number there. 

IC: 0:10:47-0:10:49
You see, there is IQ 127. 

RL: 0:10:49-0:10:53
EQ. I was going to Google it, I never had a chance today. 

IC: 0:10:53-0:10:59
I tried to Google it. 

RL:
It doesn't say? 

IC:
I found the Otis test by Googling it, what it means, but EQ, it doesn't say anything. 

RL: 0:10:59-0:11:00
Huh. 

IC: 0:11:00-0:11:01
Well, it's okay. 

RL: 0:11:01-0:11:03
I have no idea what that means. 

IC: 0:11:03-0:11:06
You confirmed that IQ is the intelligent test. 

RL: 0:11:06-0:11:09
Yeah, IQ is intelligence quotient. Intelligence quotient. 

IC: 0:11:09-0:11:16
Okay, so let me write, kind of test. 

DL:
She was out of commission for a week, so. 

RL:
Yeah, see my arm? 

IC:
Yeah, so it was your. 

RL: 0:11:16-0:11:23
I had, I had a tendonitis and a ganglion, and then I take a blood thinner, so I turned all black and blue. 

IC: 0:11:23-0:11:26
Oh, I see. But I noticed that you already have good mobility of your... 

RL: 0:11:26-0:11:27
Not bad, not bad. 

IC: 0:11:27-0:11:28
Pretty good. 

RL: 0:11:28-0:11:29
It's been almost two weeks. 

IC: 0:11:29-0:11:30
Wow, congratulations. 

RL: 0:11:30-0:11:44
Keep this here. So, what I'm going to do is... Let me write myself a note. I'm going to ask the gals that do the testing at St. Mary's now if they have any idea what EQ means. 

IC: 0:11:44-0:11:46
Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. 

RL: 0:11:49-0:11:50
And I'll email you. 

IC: 0:11:50-0:12:05
Thank you. I really appreciate it. 

And can I ask you, one thing that I was wondering is the date of the test. So, it was taken on June 15, 1944, which was at the end of his first year, because he joined St. Mary's in 1948. Was it normal? 

RL: 0:12:05-0:12:08
To give it at the end of the year? 

IC: 0:12:08-0:12:09
No, the first year? 

RL: 0:12:09-0:12:13
I guess it was. I don't recall when they used to do it. Normally they give it at the beginning of the year. 

IC: 0:12:13-0:12:14
That's what I thought, yeah. 

RL: 0:12:14-0:12:23
When I lived in the East, I went there until fifth grade. We always had the beginning of the year every year. Every year. I'm having a feel that we had it every year here too. 

IC: 0:12:23-0:12:27
Okay. 

RL:
But I can't swear to it. 

IC:
I see. One thing I don't know if this, well-

RL: 0:12:27-0:12:28
See, he never anything but A's. 

IC: 0:12:28-0:12:37
Yeah, I know. 

RL:
Jeez. 

IC:
I know, [unclear], look at him. Okay, so probably, but as far as you know, it was normal for St. Mary's-

RL: 0:12:37-0:12:41
Yes, to do that. Yeah, they wouldn't have just singled him out to give him an IQ. 

IC: 0:12:41-0:12:43
It was a general strategy. 

RL: 0:12:43-0:12:44
Everybody took it. 

IC: 0:12:44-0:12:46
Okay, good. Everybody took it. That's what I was informed of. 

RL: 0:12:46-0:12:53
So we've got to look at IQ. Now, class S, we got that. Yes, every student took it. Every student took it. 

IC: 0:12:53-0:12:55
Yeah, and it was after his first year for whatever reason. 

RL: 0:12:55-0:13:14
Now, you might ask, you're going to meet with Mary and her group? (Yeah)
Ask them if we took it every year. That I can't remember. I would imagine we did. But then if we did, why isn't it listed? You know? Did they just give it once? 

IC: 0:13:14-0:13:16
It looks like it. 

RL: 0:13:16-0:13:27
Now as far as the languages, you were not required to take Latin. You chose your language. And some people chose French, some people chose Spanish. He took three, all three. 

IC: 0:13:27-0:13:31
Okay, so the requirement was to take one language. 

RL: 0:13:31-0:13:44
Yeah, because, well, you could take more than one, but at the time they were following the University of California requirements, which was two years of a foreign language, so you chose what you want. I happened to choose Spanish. 

IC: 0:13:44-0:13:47
Did Latin count as a foreign language? 

RL: 0:13:47-0:13:50
It was in those days. Very common. 

IC: 0:13:50-0:13:53
So you could have taken Latin and satisfied the University of California requirements? 

RL: 0:13:53-0:13:56
Yeah, but then a lot of students probably took Latin and then something else. I just took the Spanish. 

IC: 0:13:56-0:13:59
So you took all three of them. 

RL: 0:13:59-0:14:25
Yeah, in fact I... 

IC:
It was not required. 

RL:
It was not required. You just followed... If you wanted to go to college, then you followed the University of California requirements, language requirements and all their others. I also taught Latin at St. Mary's and my last class was somewhere around early 2000s and then it just died out. 

IC:
But there are no... But they are not teaching Latin anymore? 

RL:
No more. 

IC: 0:14:25-0:14:26
Really? 

RL: 0:14:26-0:14:33
Terrible. That is really a tragedy. (Yeah.)
Nobody wants to take it, Ivano. You know what they want to take now? 

IC: 0:14:33-0:14:37
What is it? Sign language. Fine, but the two things cannot be compared. 

RL: 0:14:37-0:14:46
You know what the worst thing that ever happened? Was when the universities decided to accept sign language as a language requirement. Why did they do that? 

IC: 0:14:46-0:14:48
Somebody should tell them, because that's what I tell my students. 

RL: 0:14:48-0:14:49
I wish somebody would. 

IC: 0:14:49-0:15:03
Yeah, I said, look, even if you're interested, because where I teach, there are lots of students who are interested in, like, biomed, premed. I said, look, if you study Latin, you're going to learn all those roots. Absolutely. They're going to help you understand all the terminology. 

RL: 0:15:03-0:15:10
I've talked to hairdressers who said they had to take Latin to pass their test to know the bones in the head. 

IC: 0:15:10-0:15:12
Yeah, exactly. Yes, they're all Latin. 

RL: 0:15:12-0:15:39
You know, I don't understand. So in St. Mary's, the French is gone. 

IC:
French too? 

RL:
Sign language killed French. When the German came in, it killed the Latin. The students who would have taken Latin, they veered over to the French, I mean to the German. So then French hung on for a while, but French disappeared. As soon as sign language came in, a couple of years later, gone was the French. They now teach Spanish and Italian. 

IC: 0:15:39-0:15:41
At least the Italian is still there. 

RL: 0:15:41-0:15:54
Italian is still there as long as Luigi is there. 

IC:
I see. 

RL:
You know? I don't know if they're going to... When he leaves, it's not easy to find Italian teachers. When he leaves, I hate to see us down to Spanish and sign language. 

IC: 0:15:54-0:15:55
That's fair. 

RL: 0:15:55-0:16:06
The universities say, or most admissions directors say, take a language that has a literature, a written literature, and is spoken. 

IC: 0:16:06-0:16:14
Yeah, I mean, crucially, because you also want to learn to read the language. 

RL:
Exactly. 

IC:
ASL, it's important, you cannot do that. And there is no literary tradition. 

RL: 0:16:14-0:16:18
But see, in sign language, you don't have to write, you don't have to speak. 

IC: 0:16:18-0:16:25
I know, I know. 

RL:
So they take the easy way out. 

IC:
The easy way, yeah, I know. And so the UC requirements at that time was you have to take two years... 

RL: 0:16:25-0:16:52
I'm pretty sure they were the same then I don't think there were any less than they are now. 

IC:
Two years of a foreign language. 

RL:
It used to be Ivano, two years of one language, no I think it was three. Oh three years of one or two of two. 

IC:
Oh, three years of one... 

RL:
I think that's what it used to be. You should be able to find that out at your university. Get an old catalog. 

IC: 0:16:52-0:16:56
I found it at the 1940 in a catalog. It was the first year. 

RL: 0:16:56-0:17:03
Find that out because I'm almost sure it used to be three of one or two of two. 

IC:
Two... 

RL:
Of two years. 

IC: 0:17:03-0:17:04
Perfect. 

RL: 0:17:04-0:17:14
So what's next? 

IC:
So number three? 

RL:
No, you were not required. 

IC:
You told me that. 

RL:
Music Chorale was obviously a choir class. I did not take that. 

IC: 0:17:14-0:17:32
Oh, you did not? (No.)
Let me ask you if you recognize anybody in this picture. 

RL:
Oh, is that the picture? 

IC:
So the quality is very low because, you know, remember those are like they were tiny pictures that I do not have. Even if the resolution is very high. So in the single year, 1947, 46, 47, I found this picture, which is a tiny one. 

RL: 0:17:32-0:17:37
Oh, you know, I think that's me. 

IC:
I thought it was you. 

RL:
Yes, we had a choir. 

IC: 0:17:37-0:17:39
So do you think this could be Richard? 

RL: 0:17:39-0:17:59
I'm pretty sure it is. He played the organ. So that would be Richard. 

IC:
Because from the build, you know, he is a small. 

RL:
Oh my God. 

IC:
I thought this was you-

RL:
Yes, yes. Either this or this. One or the other is me. Look dad, does this look like me? 

IC:
It's really hard but I-

RL:
I think that's the one. 

IC: 0:17:59-0:18:12
Was your sister in the choir as well? 

RL:
My sister was in the choir. 

IC:
I can see from the pictures they resemble each other. 

DL:
This one-

RL:
That's me. And that's my sister I think. 

IC:
I think that's your sister, is that correct? 

RL: 0:18:12-0:18:21
Yes, her name was Mary. 

IC:
So this is Rose. 

RL:
And Mary. And I know that's Richard because he played the organ for us. 

IC: 0:18:21-0:18:25
And so does it mean that Richard was directing the choir? 

RL: 0:18:25-0:18:33
Yes he did. He directed the choir. 

IC:
So you can confirm that? 

RL:
Yeah. 

IC:
So the school, St. Mary's, had a choir? 

RL:
Yes, yes. And this was, this is the cathedral. 

IC: 0:18:33-0:18:45
I went inside, yeah. It's the upper part of the cathedral. 

RL:
That's the cathedral. 

IC:
So you guys had a choir in the school, but you were performing inside the church, or this was the church? 

RL:
We performed in the church. 

IC:
But it was the school choir. 

RL: 0:18:45-0:19:14
It was the school choir, that's right. Well, there may have been a church choir, but we... 

IC:
But these are all school people? 

RL:
These are all school people. I'm trying... This is Ivonne Urbonnie. Ivonne Urbonnie, she was my friend, my very good friend. 

IC:
So this is... And you remember that Richard was in charge of the choir? 

RL:
Yes, he was. He was in charge of the choir. So I'm thinking in this Music Chorale class, I'm wondering if that was the Music Chorale class. 

IC: 0:19:14-0:19:53
I think that because you see it appears every year. "Music Chorale", he had it in 1943-44, that's the first year. And then I think he had, let's see, he had other credits as well. What did I see? Oh, that's right. Yes, you see, he took Spanish 2, and then... 

RL:
Now, see, he didn't take Spanish 1. 

IC:
No, because I wonder, I probably already knew some. And then, you see, instead of Spanish, they wrote Choral 2 and Choral 3 and Choral 4. So, he must have replaced his classes, you see. 

RL: 0:19:53-0:20:03
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to look up my transcript to see if I took Music Chorale. 

IC:
Can you compare them? Yes. Did I take... So I can get in there and look at mine. 

IC: 0:20:03-0:20:10
Thank you. Because I saw that he took Latin I, II, and III. He took French I and II, and Spanish went directly to Spanish II. 

RL: 0:20:10-0:20:14
Unless he knew some already, or took it in summer school. 

IC: 0:20:14-0:20:17
Yeah, or studied by his own, knowing how good he was at learning. 

RL: 0:20:17-0:20:22
Knowing him, he could have done that. He could have done that. Okay, I will look that up. 

IC: 0:20:22-0:20:28
Because he did Spanish II in his last year, you see? Spanish II was 46, 47. So probably he started studying by his own. 

RL: 0:20:28-0:20:40
I have no idea who taught the choral class. See, that's the problem. The yearbook doesn't give you, the transcript doesn't give you the names of the teachers. You don't know. 

IC: 0:20:40-0:20:44
But so you confirm that there was a class called Choral? 

RL: 0:20:44-0:20:47
Yes. It's gotta be if it's on the transcript. 

IC: 0:20:47-0:20:49
So if it's on the transcript it means it's an official class. 

RL: 0:20:49-0:20:54
I'm just wondering if this was the class. That's what I'm wondering. 

IC: 0:20:54-0:21:00
But if it's listed as a class it means that there must have been some sort of teacher. It's not an independent class. 

RL: 0:21:00-0:21:19
Yeah, and you know the only nun that I can think of who sang beautifully was Sister Esther. She's not listed here. 

IC:
Oh, so she's not here. 

RL:
Yeah, and I don't know why she's not there. Sister Esther was there the time we were there. 

IC:
Okay, so... And she had a beautiful, beautiful voice. E-S-T-H-E-R, I think. E-S-T-H-E-R. She's gone. 

IC: 0:21:19-0:21:26
E-S-T-H-E-R. Esther. (Yeah.)
Actually, Rose, can I ask you? What does it mean, the M in front of all of them? 

RL: 0:21:26-0:21:32
They all have "Mary". They're all named "Mary". Sister Mary David, Sister Mary Esther. 

IC: 0:21:32-0:21:42
Okay. I was wondering. 

RL:
They're all named "Mary."

IC:
Is it possible that all of them have the same name? It's a title. 

RL:
They all have Mary as their... 

IC:
This is their last name. 

RL: 0:21:42-0:22:09
Sister Mary David Barry. In David, in those days the nuns took a Saint's name for their name. 

IC:
Oh, I didn't know that. Thank you for telling me. 

RL:
Yeah, today they don't do that. 

IC:
So, okay, so M is Mary for everybody. 

RL:
Yeah, David is the name of the saint she chose. Who was David? Was there a Saint David? Who was David? David and Goliath? Yeah. Okay, she chose David and her family name was Barry. B-A-R-R-Y. 

IC: 0:22:09-0:22:14
B-A-R-R-Y. 

RL: 0:22:14-0:22:17
And you know what a family that was? They were all priests and nuns practically. 

IC: 0:22:17-0:22:18
Oh, really? 

RL: 0:22:18-0:22:30
All priests and nuns. This woman was the most brilliant nun I've ever known. She had a master's, she had a PhD. 

IC:
She had a PhD? 

RL:
Yes. She was very well educated, just brilliant. 

IC: 0:22:30-0:22:33
Do you remember what PhD she got? 

RL: 0:22:33-0:22:36
I would imagine theology, but I'm not positive. 

IC: 0:22:37-0:22:40
PhD for sure, you are sure that she had a PhD? 

RL: 0:22:41-0:22:48
Oh yes, positive. And she was my English teacher, she taught English. Most of the nuns taught religion as well. She taught English. 

IC: 0:22:48-0:22:53
Do you have a sense of how old Sister David or any other nuns could have been at that time? 

RL: 0:22:53-0:23:03
This is the thing. You never could tell how old they were because of the way they wore their habits. And you know, those habits were a natural facelifter. They never had any wrinkles. I would say in their 30s, 30s and 40s. I would say 30s and 40s. 

IC:
Oh, they were young then! 

RL: 0:23:07-0:24:00
But listen to this. When I went to teach at St. Mary's in 1968, Sister David had come back. She came back to St. Mary's in the late 60s and she was, they were just starting a counseling department and I had been a counselor at Lodi High School. So the principal called me in and said "We want you to join the counseling-"
At that time with sister David and one gentleman Mr. Dylan and I, the three of us were the counseling department. 

IC:
Wow, she must have been in her 30s or in her 40s, she cannot have been too old because if she came back in... 

RL:
When she came back, she probably was in her 40s, maybe early 50s. I'm trying to think when she left St. Mary's, she died many years later. She died when she was in San Rafael. They all ended up going back to San Rafael. 

IC: 0:24:00-0:24:02
I see. 

RL: 0:24:02-0:24:07
And she died there. 

IC:
Because that's where they were coming from. 

RL:
Yeah, that's where the Dominican Order was. That's their main spot. 

IC: 0:24:07-0:24:19
Okay, so now it's better. I better understand the Music Chorale issue. So, but the Music Chorale was not a required class. 

RL:
No. 

IC:
So it was an optional one. 

RL:
Yes. 

IC:
And definitely you didn't have to take it for four years. 

RL: 0:24:19-0:24:23
Yes. So I don't know how we can find out if this was actually the class. 

IC: 0:24:23-0:24:30
Because this appears on the yearbook, the 1946-47 yearbook, as one of the pictures, like this is Senior Choir. 

RL: 0:24:30-0:25:20
Yes, Senior Choir. 

DL:
You can't remember? 

RL:
Pardon? 

DL:
You can't remember? 

RL:
I can't remember if it was, if we were, I know I sang in the choir. That's me, for sure. And I know that's my sister. And I know that's Bonnie. And you know, I can't think of her name, but I know her, I know her-
This one! Oh my God I can-

IC:
That's Bonnie, you said? 

RL:
That's Bonnie-**Urbonnie** she was in high school. Uh... Patricia Graham. That was Patricia Graham. 

DL:
You sure? 

RL:
Yeah, positive. 

RL:
G-R-A-H-A-M She's dead. A lot of these people are dead. Ha ha ha. I'm alive, my sister's gone. Bonnie's alive. 

IC: 0:25:20-0:25:22
You said Patricia? 

RL:
Patricia Graham. 

IC:
Patricia. 

RL: 0:25:22-0:25:27
Let me see if I recognize anybody else. 

IC: 0:25:27-0:25:31
Well, yesterday I went to interview, I went to Gold River in Sacramento. 

RL: 0:25:31-0:25:33
Oh, you saw Ed Barakat. 

IC: 0:25:33-0:25:34
Ed Barakat. Yes, yes. 

RL: 0:25:34-0:25:40
Bonnie, I can't see, I can't figure out who those boys are. That's Richard for sure. 

IC: 0:25:40-0:25:49
You think it's Richard? I thought so because his back, now I'm so familiar, and his hair, his hair was, I would say, receding. 

RL: 0:25:49-0:25:51
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even when he was young. 

IC: 0:25:51-0:25:57
Yeah, even when he was young. So you confirmed that. 

RL:
Okay. 

IC:
So the next issue has to do with shorthand. You see all this... 

RL: 0:25:57-0:26:05
Oh, and shorthand. Let me tell you this. The only non-nun that taught at St. Mary's was Mrs. Ligorio. Cammy Ligorio. 

IC: 0:26:05-0:26:10
Okay, so Josephine, Joe, she was right. That she said, oh, you need to add Cammy Ligorio. 

RL: 0:26:10-0:26:16
Cammy Ligorio. Okay. She taught the business classes. Not all of them, because I had typing from one of the nuns. I can't remember her name. 

IC: 0:26:16-0:26:17
Okay, business classes. 

RL: 0:26:17-0:26:21
But she taught shorthand, she taught, you know, office stuff. 

IC: 0:26:21-0:26:23
Oh, that's what they call office stuff. 

RL: 0:26:23-0:26:27
Yeah, like office practice practice I think they called it. 

IC: 0:26:27-0:26:29
She was not a nun. 

RL: 0:26:29-0:26:35
Not a nun. Ok Sister David was principal I do not remember Sister Dorothy at all. 

IC: 0:26:35-0:26:37
Maybe they just left her there... 

RL: 0:26:37-0:26:44
I do remember Sister Jordan don't know her family name she was my algebra teacher she taught math

IC: 0:26:44-0:26:50
Oh good good algebra. So, and Sister David, she was teaching English you said? 

RL: 0:26:50-0:26:54
English, probably religion. Most of the nuns did. 

IC: 0:26:54-0:26:56
Okay, most of the nuns did. 

RL: 0:26:56-0:27:02
Now, Sister Gregory, she taught religion and Latin. She was the Latin teacher. 

IC: 0:27:02-0:27:04
Latin plus religion. 

RL: 0:27:04-0:27:05
And this is strange, I do not know Sister Gerald or Sister Christopher. Isn't that strange? 

IC: 0:27:11-0:27:13
You remember Sister Colette? 

RL: 0:27:13-0:27:15
Oh yeah. Now Colette I can tell you about. Colette taught, I think she taught history. 

IC:
History. 

RL:
I think I had her for civics. But she ended up coming back to St. Mary's as principal,  during what years? During the, oh gosh, was it the 70s? You know it's too bad you don't get into the yearbook room so you look up all look at all these yearbooks they will tell you who was the principal. 

IC: 0:27:48-0:27:51
Yes I did but the problem is that the only information that the yearbooks have is like they say who's the principal and that's it. They list the teachers but they don't tell you what they were teaching. 

RL: 0:27:51-0:28:01
All right Sister Collete I'm gonna-

DL:
When did father Fallon come in? 

RL:
Oh he came in the 70s well then so she had to be before the 70s she had to be in the 60s. 

IC: 0:28:01-0:28:06
Yeah so she came back as the principal at the same time she was teaching history. 

RL: 0:28:06-0:28:14
I don't know if she was teaching. When she was there as a teacher, she was in social studies. When she came back as a principal, I don't know if she taught. 

IC: 0:28:14-0:28:18
But when she was there, when you were there as a student, she was in social studies. 

RL: 0:28:18-0:28:59
Then, when she was no longer principal, she was kind of a retired nun, she worked in what I do now, the alumni office. I worked with her. And of course it wasn't as big as it is now because in those days the memorial program was not what it is today. You know, people die, relatives and friends send in money. It was, they did send it in then, but now, oh my God, you should see what I have on the computer. 

IC:
I can imagine. 

RL:
So it was just the two of us could handle it very easily. And I only worked with her for one hour a day. I taught the rest of the day. And that was more than enough. But she did all that. She did all of that. 

IC: 0:28:59-0:29:11
And so, Rose, can I ask you, is it likely that Sister Jordan, besides teaching algebra, may have taught the other, because I see that there is also like general arithmetics, geometry... 

RL: 0:29:11-0:29:24
She might have taught geometry as well. I'm trying to think if I had her for geometry. There's one nun you don't mention here, Sister Grace. 

IC:
Oh, Grace. 

RL:
Sister Grace taught chemistry. 

IC: 0:29:24-0:29:25
Grace. 

RL: 0:29:25-0:29:27
And advanced math. 

IC:
G-R-A-C-E? 

RL:
G-R-A-C-E. 

IC: 0:29:27-0:29:28
C-E? 

RL: 0:29:28-0:29:45
I taught, I mean, I had chemistry from her, and I also had trigonometry and solid geometry from her. Which today, now, today they don't call it that. They call it, what do they call it? Just trigonometry? 

IC:
Yeah. Yeah. 

RL:
But it was called trigonometry and solid geometry. 

IC: 0:29:45-0:29:50
I think I saw it here, geometry. 

RL:
That was just-

IC:
Yes, geometry... 

RL: 0:29:50-0:29:52
Did you say solid? 

IC: 0:29:52-0:29:53
They had plain geometry. 

RL: 0:29:53-0:29:55
Yeah, that's regular geometry. 

IC: 0:29:55-0:30:00
Which he did not take. (Okay.)
But then he has geometry, I don't know why they put it here. 

RL: 0:30:00-0:30:01
I don't either. 

IC: 0:30:01-0:30:02
Chemistry. 

RL: 0:30:02-0:30:03
Chemistry. 

IC: 0:30:03-0:30:06
Physics. 

RL:
Yeah, physics. 

IC:
And then all the history component. 

RL: 0:30:06-0:30:12
Okay. And I would, I would, I would venture to say that Sister Grace taught the physics as well, but I'm not positive. 

IC: 0:30:12-0:30:18
Let me put a question mark. Yeah. You think Sister Grace? 

RL:
Grace. 

IC:
Grace. 

RL:
I know she taught chemistry. I had her. 

IC:
Physics. 

RL: 0:30:18-0:30:27
Maybe. Yeah. 

IC:
Maybe. 

RL:
And I know I had her for solid geometry. Okay, where are we now? 

IC: 0:30:27-0:30:31
So we were at issue number four, we were talking about shorthand. 

RL: 0:30:31-0:30:38
Okay, the shorthand and typing was taught by Cammy Ligorio, but I had typing from a nun and I can't think of her name. Sister.. 

IC: 0:30:38-0:30:44
So shorthand was for sure Ligorio. 

RL: 0:30:44-0:31:05
Shorthand was definitely Ligorio. 

IC:
And typing? 

RL:
She taught typing as well, but the other nun taught it too. What was her name? The only class I ever got a C in was typing. I can't coordinate my fingers! 

IC:
I know, belive me, I never learned it. 

DL:
Can't think of her name? 

RL:
I can't think of her name. Doggone it. 

IC:
Of course, he got A and A. 

RL:
Yeah, of course. Of course, yeah. 

IC: 0:31:05-0:31:16
So, can I ask you, shorthand and typewriting, number one, were they require classes? 

RL:
No. 

IC:
Number two, would boys take that class? 

RL: 0:31:16-0:31:48
There would be boys that took it. You know, when I went to St. Mary's in those days, there were two tracks: college prep, business. That was it. So a lot of the girls who wanted to go into business, like they didn't want to go on to college maybe, they took the business track. They took the typing, the shorthand, along with the religion and the English and all the other required stuff. And then those who were planning to go to college went the college track. But if we could we fit in typing. I never took shorthand, but I did take typing. 

IC: 0:31:48-0:31:55
Because I was wondering, like Richard, when he graduated in 47, he went for one year to Stockton Junior College. 

RL: 0:31:55-0:31:56
Yes, I did too. 

IC: 0:31:56-0:32:01
And I found notes in his archive. He kept the notes in the class, and he used lots of shorthand. 

RL: 0:32:01-0:32:04
He took shorthand there too? 

IC: 0:32:04-0:32:09
No, no, no. He used shorthand in his class. 

RL:
Oh, he used shorthand, yes, of course. 

IC:
Which made me think he already knew shorthand. 

RL: 0:32:09-0:32:14
You know what? That tells you how smart he is. He knew he was going to be taking notes in college, so he took shorthand. 

IC: 0:32:14-0:32:16
Yep, yep, yep. And of course, A-A. 

RL: 0:32:16-0:32:19
Yeah, Stockton Junior College is what today is Delta. 

IC: 0:32:19-0:32:22
Delta, yes, yes. And then he went there to check for [unclear]

RL: 0:32:22-0:32:23
Yeah, I went there one year too. 

IC: 0:32:23-0:32:30
Okay, perfect. So, shorthand and typewriting, these were like encouraged for people that want to pursue the business, but also college students. 

RL: 0:32:30-0:32:32
Or anybody else who wanted to fit it in. 

IC: 0:32:32-0:32:34
And you know, guys and girls could take it. 

RL: 0:32:34-0:32:37
Yes. Not many guys did it, but mostly girls, yeah. 

IC: 0:32:37-0:32:42
Okay, mainly girls, yeah. Okay, and then... 

RL: 0:32:42-0:32:43
Yeah, non-Cath is non-Catholic. 

IC: 0:32:43-0:32:47
Yes. So, there were non-Catholic in the school? The school was open to non-Catholic? 

RL: 0:32:47-0:32:51
Yes, but there weren't that many. There weren't that many. 

IC:
Not many. 

RL:
Today we have a lot. 

IC: 0:32:51-0:32:52
Not many. 

RL: 0:32:54-0:33:06
Not in those days there wasn't a lot, but yes, they had to participate in religious functions. Everybody had to do that. We've even had Muslims who had to participate in our Catholic functions, yes? Nobody gets excused. 

IC: 0:33:06-0:33:15
So, one thing. It sounds like there were religion classes, and this was one thing. And then there was service, like mass. 

RL: 0:33:15-0:33:21
Yeah, masses. Like for Holy Days, we always had masses and everything. And everybody had to go. 

IC: 0:33:21-0:33:25
And so, religion classes were like a teaching of the church? 

RL: 0:33:25-0:33:27
Required. Required from everybody. 

IC: 0:33:27-0:33:33
Do you remember a student, which probably is here ahead of you, his name I think was Bob Sherwood? 

RL: 0:33:33-0:33:39
Bob Sherwood, Bob Sherwood. That sounds familiar. You think he was 1947? 

IC: 0:33:39-0:33:53
Yeah, same class as Richard. 

RL:
Yeah, that would be... 

IC:
The reason why is because... So, let me ask this background question. When you say, "I took religion", when you were taking that class, were you guys divided by years? Like, or people could mix? 

RL: 0:33:53-0:34:21
In one year, believe it or not, we were divided by boys and girls because they didn't want to talk about certain things in mixed classes. 

IC:
For religion, you mean? 

RL:
Yeah, but I think that might have been in our junior year. These people you're meeting with this afternoon they could probably tell you, but I remember once being in a religion class with all girls. 

IC:
Okay. 

RL:
We talked about, you know, abortions, you know, sexual relations, all that stuff and they didn't want boys and girls together. 

IC: 0:34:21-0:34:37
But for the other classes, all the other topics, you guys were mixed. 

RL:
Yes, oh yes, oh yes. It was a co-ed school. All classes co-ed. 

IC:
Perfect. So, issue number six. So, this is a question, you see, on the transcripts, this says, "previous training". 

RL: 0:34:37-0:34:41
That's an elementary school. Don went there. El Dorado. 

IC: 0:34:41-0:34:51
I can ask you, okay, so because the puzzle is the following. I know for sure that Richard, when he started elementary school, I know for sure that he started at Jackson. 

RL:
Jackson. 

IC:
Jackson. So there was a school called Jackson School. 

RL: 0:34:51-0:34:53
Yes. Did you go to Jackson? 

DL:
Yeah. 

IC: 0:34:53-0:34:56
Perfect. I'm going to ask you some questions about Jackson. 

DL:
Go ahead. You know how long ago I was in Jackson? Jesus. 

IC:
I know, I know, I know. 

RL: 0:34:56-0:35:06
That's all right. But was it kindergarten to eighth grade in those days? Do you remember? 

DL:
Yeah. 

RL:
Yeah. 

IC: 0:35:06-0:35:18
So because of that, I found somebody who was in class with Richard in elementary school at Jackson. 

RL:
Wow. 

IC:
Her name is Jo, I think now Delaney, I think? 

RL: 0:35:18-0:35:22
Jo Delaney. I know Jo Delaney. 

IC:
You do? 

RL:
Yes, I know Jo Delaney. 

IC: 0:35:22-0:35:47
Yeah, she told me that she knows you, so I thought, yes. So I talked to her last time I was here and she was wonderful and she told me unfortunately, she says "Ivano, it's a little bit too late, a dear friend of hers, who's also a dear friend of Richard, his name was Aldo."
He worked as a librarian for many years. Aldo, Aldo. And so he had just passed away. He had a picture of him and Richard in second grade. 

RL: 0:35:47-0:35:48
I'll be darned. 

IC: 0:35:48-0:36:13
But that picture is gone. She was not able to find it. 

RL:
Oh, too bad. 

IC:
So, I know for sure that Richard started-

RL:
-at Jackson-

IC:
-because his parents were living at that time up to 1940 until the age of 10, they were living in Hunter Street, South Hunter Street, which is very close to where Jackson is. But then in 1940 they moved to Bristol Avenue. 

RL:
And that would be close to El Dorado. 

IC:
Does it make sense then? 

RL:
Yes, definitely. 

RL: 0:36:14-0:36:28
Definitely. Because El Dorado is on Harding Way. 

DL:
Yeah, I went to El Dorado too. 

RL:
So where were you living when you went to El Dorado? 

DL:
I lived on Kensington. 

RL:
Kensington. So those would all fit into El Dorado school, Bristol, Kensington. 

IC: 0:36:28-0:36:43
Now can I ask you, when you went to Jackson, where were you living when you went to Jackson? 

DL:
Out south on uh south El Dorado. Lived above a grocery store. 

IC:
Uh-huh, okay, so that makes sense. 

RL: 0:36:43-0:36:46
Yeah, that was Jackson. Didn't Anna say she went to grammar school with him? 

IC: 0:36:46-0:37:30
No. What Anna told me is that she went to Jackson. 

RL:
Yeah. 

IC:
But Richard, I think, was one year ahead of her. 

RL:
Oh, okay. 

IC:
So Richard was born in 1930, but for some reason, actually, maybe you can help me, at which age would you normally end eighth grade? 

RL:
Fourteen. 13 or 14. 

IC:
Richard ended at 13. So actually, when he ended, it was like June 1943, and he was still 12, because he turned 13 in September. 

RL:
Oh my God. 

IC:
So he must have been a little bit ahead, because for example, all the classmates that I'm interviewing, that interviewed yesterday and today, they told me they're all 1929. So but Richard was 1930 [unclear] classmates so probably there is this like-

RL: 0:37:30-0:37:34
Yeah see my sister was '29 and she was in the
class of '47. So he was ahead. 

IC: 0:37:34-0:37:41
Okay so it wasn't like it, no I totally understand the family moved and he moved there-

RL: 0:37:41-0:37:45
Yeah when they moved to Bristol, he was... 

IC: 0:37:45-0:37:51
And El Dorado was again another one... 

RL:
One to eight, one to eight. It's still there. 

RL: 0:37:51-0:37:58
It's still there? But the original building is now an adult school. 

IC:
Oh, I don't... 

RL:
And then there's all these other buildings there. 

IC: 0:37:58-0:38:03
So, that building there, because I drove down and I thought, this is... 

DL:
It's not a school anymore. 

RL: 0:38:03-0:38:12
No, well, it's for adult education. They meet at night I think. Yeah, because they can't have children. They can't have a lot of children. It's unsafe, they said. 

IC: 0:38:12-0:38:36
But the building is still there. 

RL:
The building is still there. The school is still there. 

IC:
I see. I'm going to go and check it again. 

DL:
It's right on the corner of Harding and Pacific Avenue. 

IC:
Yes, yes, totally. I drove there. Yes, yes. Oh, good. Let me go and check the building again. Perfect. And so, one question that I have is, do you have a sense of how expensive St. Mary's High School was those days? 

RL: 0:38:36-0:38:46
I know exactly. My father would write one check for my sister and me for the whole year, $3 each a month. 

IC:
No way. 

RL:
$60. $3? $3. He'd write a 60 dollar check for the whole year. 

IC: 0:38:46-0:38:50
You think it's because your family got a special deal? 

RL: 0:38:50-0:39:05
No, no. It's three dollars each. Tell him, when our son went there... And when our son went there, he graduated in 1977, it was 65 dollars a month. Now, ooh. Mas de 800. 

IC: 0:39:05-0:39:07
I went on the website. More than $8,900. 

RL: 0:39:07-0:39:10
$8,900. And Catholics pay more. I mean non-Catholics pay more. 

IC: 0:39:10-0:39:12
Yeah, there's a little bit more. 

RL: 0:39:12-0:39:16
In my day, everybody paid the same. Everybody paid the same. 

IC: 0:39:16-0:39:44
Well, I went back because I know you can do these conversions to have an idea of what's the value of $3 a month in 1930, sorry, in 1943. So this is going to be roughly the equivalent of $150 these days. So, which, because one point that I want to make in the book is that school, private and public school, was much more affordable in those days. 

RL:
Oh yeah. 

IC:
Which means many more people had the possibility to go. 

RL: 0:39:44-0:40:00
Absolutely. I just thought of another nun. 

IC:
Yes, tell me. 

RL:
Okay, what are the names? Sister Vincent. 

IC:
Vincent. 

RL:
Ferrer, F-E-R-R-E-R. F-E-R-R-E-R. And she was my Spanish teacher. 

IC:
Spanish. 

RL:
She taught Spanish. 

IC: 0:40:00-0:40:36
So probably she taught Spanish to Richard too because he took Spanish. 

RL:
Now there was another nun who taught Spanish, Sr. Peter. Sr. Mary Peter. She taught me my second year Spanish. 

IC:
Pita or Peter? 

RL:
Peter, Peter. Like Peter the rock? 

IC:
And she taught Spanish as well. 

RL:
She taught Spanish as well. I don't know who taught French. So these nuns, the ones that you mentioned here, were all these nuns living in the... 

RL:
They had a convent, yes. 

IC:
So they were all in the convent or some of them were coming from outside just to teach and then they would leave? 

RL: 0:40:36-0:40:59
Nope, nope. I once was in the convent years after they were gone. And you know what they had upstairs? They each had a very, very small bedroom, a twin bed, a dresser, a chair, and that's about it. A little table, maybe. That's about it. And there were a lot of them. So, at one time... 

DL:
The priests lived there too. 

RL:
The priests had their own house. 

DL: 0:40:59-0:41:00
Yeah, right next door. 

RL: 0:41:00-0:41:04
Yeah. Well, they still have their... the obelisks still have their priest houses. 

IC: 0:41:04-0:41:12
Actually, and Rose, but the priests did not teach in the school, is that correct? 

RL:
No. 

IC:
There was the name of the, I'm trying to remember the name of this... 

RL: 0:41:12-0:41:28
Monsignor McGough. 

IC:
Monsignor McGough. 

RL:
He did not teach, but he visited a lot. He would just walk into the classroom and start spouting out poetry. He was funny. 

DL:
Father Kelly taught. 

RL:
No, no, I'm going way back to our day. Father Kelly wasn't there. We're going back to our day. 

DL:
Oh, you're going back to her day? 

RL:
Richard was there. 

IC: 0:41:28-0:41:30
We're talking about when Richard was there

RL: 0:41:30-0:41:37
I am not sure that all these nuns were there at the same time because I've already added how many nuns? Three? 

IC: 0:41:37-0:41:42
Yeah-

RL: 0:41:42-0:41:47
I'm not sure. I just don't know Sister Dorothy,
Sister Gerald and Sister Christopher. I don't remember at all. Christopher, I don't remember at all. 

IC: 0:41:47-0:41:50
Gerald and Christopher, let me put a question mark. 

RL:
Yeah, I don't remember them. 

IC:
Sister Gerald and Sister Christopher and Dorothy, you don't remember them. 

RL: 0:41:50-0:41:52
And Dorothy, I do not remember them at all. 

IC: 0:41:52-0:42:17
Good. 

RL:
Okay. 

IC:
Okay, so let me double check if there was any... Yes, I have a question about... So, some of the pictures. First of all, this is a picture, a very early on picture. This is 1943-44. 

RL:
Oh, that's Richard. 

IC:
Richard is playing the piano. Did the school, did St. Mary's have a piano? 

RL: 0:42:17-0:42:27
They must have had a piano. The organ was in the church. 

IC:
The organ was in the church. 

RC:
So this might have been in the Music Chorale room. They had to have something. 

IC:
There was a room-

RL:
They had to have something. 

IC: 0:42:27-0:42:29
So there was a room dedicated to the organ. 

RL: 0:42:29-0:42:39
Yeah, had to be. And you know what? I recognize her, but I can't think of her name. That's a good picture of them, too. Your group this afternoon should be able to name these people. 

IC: 0:42:39-0:42:41
Yes, yes, because they're the best in the country. Oh, the name are here. 

RL: 0:42:41-0:43:11
Oh, Orchese, Huddleston, Montague, Rishwain, Wadad. Wadad Rishwain, that's her name. Costa and [Echelette, ???, 42:40] I don't know. Wadad Rishwain. I know her she's still alive. 

IC:
Yeah, I saw-I wrote her. 

RW:
She's married to Paul Jacobs. 

IC:
Does she live in St-? 

RL:
She lives in Stockton. Paul Jacobs' sister Shirley went to school with me and his family, they're all gone except Paul. Paul's the last one in the family. 

IC: 0:43:11-0:43:12
Jacobs. 

RL: 0:43:12-0:43:13
Jacobs, yeah. 

IC: 0:43:13-0:43:25
And then let me ask you, I had a question about, yes, so this is the picture of the senior class officers in 1946-47. 

RL: 0:43:25-0:43:30
Montague, [uclear], Bernice Parenti, (Yes.) Eddie Brennan. 

IC: 0:43:30-0:43:33
Okay. And the present... 

RL: 0:43:33-0:43:35
Russell's... Who's Russell? This guy? 

IC: 0:43:35-0:43:37
Must be that guy, I don't know. 

RL: 0:43:37-0:43:39
All right, Montague, Parenti,... 

IC: 0:43:39-0:43:43
There may be some other name that got cut because I made the picture bigger. 

RL: 0:43:43-0:43:49
...Brennan. Somebody's missing, right? A name is missing here. 

IC:
Probably it was under here but it got cut because I made the picture bigger. 

FL:
He might have been E. Russell, I don't know who this girl is. 

IC: 0:43:49-0:43:53
So I want to ask you what's a Sergeant at Arms? 

RL: 0:43:53-0:44:01
Oh yeah they're supposed to keep order at your meetings. When we have our class meetings they're supposed to stand up there like this and they keep order. 

IC: 0:44:01-0:44:08
Okay it's just an honorary thing. 

RL:
Like a policeman. A junior policeman. 

IC:

Montague, I can imagine. A junior policeman. I can imagine Richard, how intimidating it was. 

RL: 0:44:08-0:44:10
Was he Sergeant at Arms? Oh my God. 

IC: 0:44:10-0:44:19
He was Sergeant at Arms, yeah. So, let's see. Oh, this was just a picture that they put on the first year book. And I think this is him. 

RL: 0:44:19-0:44:21
Oh my God. He's probably rode his bike to school. 

IC: 0:44:21-0:44:33
Yeah, yeah. 

RL:
That's Richard. 

IC:
And this looks, I think, some sort of a briefcase, I think. That's Richard. And this looks like a briefcase I think. So I want to ask you, what did students use those days to carry books? 

RL: 0:44:33-0:44:44
Well they didn't have backpacks, I'll tell you that. We didn't even know what a backpack was. So you either had a briefcase or you just carried them in your arms. 

IC:
So was it common for students to have briefcases? 

RL:
Not a lot of them did, but Richard was the type that would. 

IC: 0:44:44-0:44:55
Yeah, that's what I'm asking because when I saw this I said, because I didn't see any other but this looks like his style. 

RL:
Yeah, there weren't that many. 

IC:
And so this is, okay, this is the junior class. 

RL: 0:44:55-0:44:59
This is the junior class. Is he in here? 

IC: 0:44:59-0:45:02
I want to ask you, yes, I think this is Richard. 

RL: 0:45:02-0:45:18
Oh, there he is, yeah. You see, he wore a sweater. 

IC:
Yes. 

RL:
None of the boys, hardly any of them did that. 

IC:
Yes. 

RL:
Oh, your group is going to know all of these people. 

IC:
Yeah. 

RL:
I know her. 

IC:
Is your sister here, too? 

RL:
Oh, she should be. Mary should be here. 

IC: 0:45:18-0:45:20
Let's see if I have the... 

RL:
Mary. 

DL:
Your sister? 

RL: 0:45:20-0:45:24
Yeah, this is her class. 47. How come she's not in there? Look and see. 

IC: 0:45:24-0:45:39
Because sometimes they divided the class into two. So, your maiden name is? 

RL:
Simonelli. 

IC:
Here it is. There you are. Honor Society 46, 47. 

RL: 0:45:39-0:45:40
Oh my God. 

IC: 0:45:40-0:45:44
You are somewhere down here, right? So, Rose Simonelli. 

RL:
Yeah, Rose Simonelli. 

IC:
Where are you? 

RL: 0:45:44-0:46:36
Here I am. 

IC:
Here you are. 

RL:
Oh my God! And Mary Leavis, she was my friend. 

IC:
Oh, that's Mary Leavis. 

RL:
Oh, not pictured, I'm sorry. Prado. This is Prado, I guess. 

IC:
Paula. 

RL:
Virginia Quinn became a nun. She's a Dominican nun. She's still a nun. 

Don O'Laurie. I think it was Bill Trout, Lorraine Budisilich, Paul Bernardico, Richard Montague, Wayman Steed, T. Kavanaugh, S. Mariani, I think it was Dolores Staudenraus, Michael- 

IC:
Wow, you remember many of them! 

RL:
Michelotti, where's the Michelotti? Michelle maybe was her name, I can't remember. Here's Barbara Calcagno, Barbara Hare. Barbara Hare, Quinn, yours truly, and Prado. Now I'll be done. 

DL:
I can't see your sister. 

RL: 0:46:36-0:46:47
No, my sister's not in here. 

IC:
Because there were two pictures of that class. They divided the pictures. They were too many. 

RL:
I don't see her in there. Yeah. 

IC:
So can you see-? 

RL: 0:46:47-0:46:49
These are wonderful! 

IC: 0:46:49-0:47:06
Let's see if I have, this is the War Bond committee. I have a question for you, Rose. So, um-

RL:
Here's my sister. 

IC:
This is your sister, in fact. So, you see, they mention all the people here, but the only people that is not mentioned is Richard. I think this is Richard. Do you agree that this is Richard? 

RL:
Yes, it is. Yes, it is. 

IC:
You see? 

RL: 0:47:06-0:47:13
You see, we were in school during the war. 

IC:
Yes, yes. 

RL:
And they were selling war bonds and all that stuff. Here's Barbara Kelly-

IC: 0:47:13-0:47:16
Can I ask you, do you have a sense of what the war bond committee was doing? 

RL: 0:47:16-0:47:43
Well, let me think. What did they do? I know when I was in elementary school, we used to buy stamps and keep them in a book. And then when you filled up the book, you had a war bond. So maybe that's what they promoted. Yeah, Barbara, Mary, my sister Mary. There's Wayman Steed again. 

IC:
Yes, Wayman Steed. 

DL:
Hey, Ma. 

RL:
Yeah, that's me. 

DL:
She sticks out like a sore thumb [Laughs]. 

RL:
Yeah, that's me. All that hair. Look, I got no hair now. 

IC: 0:47:43-0:48:08
Oh, yeah, sure. 

RL:
Yeah, the older... 

IC:
This is no hair. 

RL:
Yeah, I'm getting there. Oh, what wonderful pictures. 

IC:
Yeah, no, really, really. So, let me see if there was another... Let me ask you one question. This is the sophomore here. This is... Okay. This is the Honor Society in 1945. 

RL: 0:48:08-0:48:10
That looks like Richard there. 

IC:
That's Richard, you're totally right. 

RL:
That's Honor Society? 

IC: 0:48:10-0:48:14
And I have the names here. I have a small picture with the names. 

RL: 0:48:14-0:48:16
Richard Montague. Wow, I don't know. 

IC: 0:48:16-0:48:24
Michelotti. Anna is here. 

RL:
Anna Angelini. I'm there. 

IC:
And you're here on the second line. 

DL:
He didn't have much hair, did he? 

RL: 0:48:24-0:48:27
No even in even as a young boy he didn't. 

IC: 0:48:30-0:48:44
Yeah it's kind of like he balded quickly, from the very beginning. 

RL:
I'll be darned. These were all in the 47 year book? 

IC:
Yes yes. Oh no sorry 45, 46. 

RL:
Oh 45, 46 okay. 

IC:
You're there too. It's under Rose. 

RL: 0:48:48-0:48:57
Yeah, Rose. I was on the honor roll every month. And then you got a pin. You got to keep it at the end of your senior year. 

IC:
Wow. 

RL:
It's an honor pin. I'm sure Richard got one. 

IC: 0:48:59-0:49:13
Yeah, he was there every month for all four years. 

RL:
With all those grades he had, he had to be on the honor roll every month. Every month. 

IC:
Well, that's been fantastic. So thank you, thank you very much. This is really, really helpful because I, let me just be sure that I asked you. 

RL: 0:49:13-0:49:18
Yeah, let's see, did we do everything? El Dorado is a regular school, not a district, it was a school. 

IC: 0:49:18-0:49:25
And I asked you about the fees and you told me three a month. 

RL:
The nuns, yeah, three a month. 

IC:
Yes. Perfect, that's fantastic. 

RL: 0:49:25-0:49:34
And I'm gonna check when I get a chance. Friday is a mass and a faith formation, they go, but I may not be able to do it till next Monday. 

IC: 0:49:34-0:49:35
No, don't worry, don't worry. 

RL: 0:49:35-0:49:43
I'll ask if I can find out what this EQ means. And also I'm gonna check my transcript to see if I took Music Chorale. 

IC: 0:49:43-0:49:47
And also, you mind checking if you also have the label EQ in your transcripts? 

RL: 0:49:47-0:49:49
If it's on my transcript? Okay. 

IC: 0:49:49-0:49:56
Just to understand. 

RL:
I will. 

IC:
Just to see if it was a regular standard. 

RL:
If everybody had that. 

IC:
Or it was something different, that they were doing some special. 

RL: 0:49:56-0:49:58
I will do that. I'll get Sue Town. You know Sue. 

IC: 0:49:58-0:50:00
Yes. 

DL:
You got to get a hold of him now. 

RL: 0:50:00-0:50:08
She has to let me, I got his email. Sue Town has to let you into the room where they have the transcripts. I can't go in there on my own. She'll let me in. 

IC: 0:50:08-0:50:24
Yeah, no, she was very nice. So what I was telling you is that I found this relative that, because the school was a little bit perplexed and they said, "Look, it's gonna be really, really important for me to know about his educational background."
And I was able to get the transcripts from Berkeley. 

RL: 0:50:24-0:50:26
Because you knew the relative? 

IC: 0:50:26-0:50:30
Yeah, so through the relative, Sue called the relative, his name is, he lives in Lodi. 

RL: 0:50:30-0:50:31
Okay, oh! 

IC: 0:50:31-0:50:41
Yeah, and so it's a very far away connection, but he's receiving the royalties of the book, which means he's the closest relative alive. 

RL:
Yeah! 

IC:
And so they talk on the phone, he says, "Sure, I met Ivano, please offer the rights."

RL: 0:50:41-0:50:43
Well, what are you going to get, aren't you going to get royalties too? 

IC: 0:50:43-0:50:45
Well, first I need to write a book. 

RL: 0:50:45-0:50:49
Yeah, first you need to write the book. And what's his name by the way? 

default: 0:50:49-0:50:50
Paul Heaney. 

RL: 0:50:50-0:50:51
Paul who? 

IC: 0:50:51-0:50:55
Paul Heaney. 

RL:
Heaney? 

IC:
H-E-A-N-E-Y, I think. 

RL: 0:50:55-0:50:59
H-E-A-N-E-Y. He sounds German, huh? A lot of Germans in Lodi. 

IC: 0:50:59-0:51:01
Because the way it is related, it's complicated. 

RL: 0:51:01-0:51:03
How did you ever find him? 

IC: 0:51:03-0:52:24
So I tried to reconstruct a genealogy of the family. So Montague's mother, Lorraine, was the seventh, the last one of seven sisters. 

RL:
Wow! 

IC:
So she and her sister, Loretta, were twins. So the last two sisters were twins. So she got married last, but her second sister got married earlier and she had only one daughter, Helen. Helen had three children, one daughter and two boys. Unfortunately the daughter Catherine died two years ago. The boys are still alive. Paul is the husband of Catherine. So basically, let me see, Catherine, Richard's mother was Catherine's aunt. 

RL:
Ah, ok. 

IC:
So Richard's mother and Helen's mother were sisters. So Helen's... Lorraine was Helen's... Helen was Lorraine's... How do you say, the daughter of your sister is your... 

RL: 0:52:24-0:52:26
The daughter of your sister... 

IC: 0:52:26-0:52:27
What are you for the daughter of your sister? 

RL: 0:52:27-0:52:29
Would be a niece. 

IC:
A niece. 

RL:
A niece. 

IC: 0:52:29-0:52:48
So Helen was Montague's mother's niece. Helen had a daughter, Catherine, the one that died three years ago. So she would be the daughter of the niece. And she's the one that married Paul. Paul is alive. He kept everything. Because Catherine was the one that preserved all the pictures of the family. 

RL: 0:52:48-0:52:49
Wow, isn't that good? 

IC: 0:52:49-0:54:04
Including these beautiful pictures of Lorraine, her last name was McCain. They were Irish. And they moved to Lompoc in the late 1890s when Lompoc was created. They were the pioneers. They went together when the city was created. So they went there, they bought the land, they built the house, and the McCain house still exists because it was one of the fanciest houses. So this couple, this woman, I have this picture of the grandmother. You see the strong woman already from the picture, the dominating figure. The father died earlier, she took care of the six, seven daughters. 

RL:
Oh my gosh. 

IC:
And she was really, and I think the daughter's took from her. 
Because like I discovered that the grandmother was a good businesswoman she managed the land that they had she owned the property. 

RL:
Oh wow, wow. 

IC:
And Lorraine, Montague's mother, was the same she was officially a housewife. But I have letters that show that she was giving business suggestions to her son. "Try this, do this, you can never do this."

So I think that's where the family comes from, the mother's family. And by reconstructing, I was able to see who is alive, who is not. And I found this guy, Paul Heaney, and I said, well, "Let me try to write him."
And he wrote me back. 

RL: 0:54:04-0:54:05
Isn't that great? 

IC: 0:54:05-0:54:12
And then so I went to visit him, and it was very nice. He showed me the pictures, and finally I saw a picture of Montague's mother when she was young. 

RL: 0:54:12-0:54:13
I'll be darned. 

IC: 0:54:13-0:54:23
And there could also be, because it's a big family picture, all the sisters with their husbands, although I'm not 100% sure, there could also be Montague's father, the only picture of Montague's father that I have. 

RL: 0:54:23-0:54:24
What did the father do, do you know? 

IC: 0:54:24-0:55:14
Yes, so the father started they got married in 1915 and at that time he was working for the telephone company in Lompoc. 

RL:
Oh okay. 

IC:
When they moved to Stockton is because the Pacific Telephone and Telegram company in Stockton moved them, they moved there to Stockton. 

RL:
Oh. 

IC:
And so from 1927 until when he retired in 1948, he worked for the-Pacific Bell. 

RL:
Pacific Bell. 

IC:
And progressively went from being a lineman to an installer and then a foreman. And so I checked the last census available, the 1940 census, and it shows that at that time in 1940 they were living in, I think they were still living in south. The last year they were living in, what was the name of the street? -Hunter. 

RL: 0:55:14-0:55:16
Hunter. 

IC: 0:55:16-0:55:21
So he was making twice as much as everybody else in the street. $1,500 a year. 

RL: 0:55:21-0:55:23
Wow. Oh my gosh. 

IC: 0:55:23-0:55:32
Which, you know, in comparison to the other one, like $700, $750. So it means that you know, it was a good job. 

RL:
Yes. 

IC:
He had reached some level of seniority. So, yeah. I was able to reconstruct that too. 

RL: 0:55:32-0:55:41
It's just, it's just, it's so ironic how Richard ended up though being killed like that. 

IC: 0:55:41-0:56:17
I know. And what is surprising, what I always keep thinking is like, look how much he had achieved in such a short life. What would have happened when, because he died he was 40. Only 40. 

RL:
Yeah, he was young. 

IC:
And so only 40 he managed to become-

RL:
He had written books. Ivano-

IC:
He managed to become a businessman. 

RL:
Yeah. 

IC:
So he had a fortune. And by the way, I also discovered what happened to his fortune. It's a sad story. 

RL:
Yeah, who got the money? Oh no. 

IC:
Paul helped me reconstruct. So what happened is that Richard died. He was 40. He left everything to his parents. They were still alive at the time. They were old in the early 80s, but they were still alive. 

RL: 0:56:17-0:56:17
OK. 

IC: 0:56:17-0:57:04
The father was already a little bit sick. He died one and a half year after. So Richard died in 1971. By mid 1973, the father died. Now the mother is the only one, she inherits everything. She inherits a fortune. Richard had a house on Mulholland Drive, which is one of the fanciest... 

DL:
That's right. 

RL:
Plus all the books he wrote. 

IC:
And not just that, like you know the house exists until 2010. I went to check the records. In 2010 that house was bought for four million dollars. Destroyed completely to build an eight million dollar mansion. That's what they do. 

RL:
Oh, gee. Yeah, that's what they do. 

IC:
It was in a fantastic location. It was a cul-de-sac, nothing around it. 

RL:
[Exasperated sigh]

IC:
So, at that time when Richard died in 1971, the value of the house was around $100,000. 

RL: 0:57:04-0:57:07
Was he living in the house when he was murdered? Okay. 

IC: 0:57:07-0:57:10
$100,000 the value. I mean, $100,000 in 1971. 

RL: 0:57:10-0:57:12
Oh, it was a lot of money. 

IC: 0:57:12-0:58:30
It was a lot of money. And so he had stock market investments. (Yeah.)
He had cash, and he had another house, and a little, smaller house, and that's the one that he left to his father. (Okay.)
And so, that's only in 10 years, I'm sorry, in 40 years of life, he had managed to become, you know, wealthy. 

RL:
Very wealthy. 

IC:
And he was also the best paid professor at UCLA. Although he was only 40, they were professors in their 60s, he was the highest ranked, the one with the best pay. 

RL:
Wow. 

IC:
And he created a new field of study in the last three years of his life! He had these ideas, he wrote three papers that were very very important and here it is. So imagine how much else he could have produced. 

RL:
What happened to the money? Didn't she get it? 

IC:
So it looks like the mother is left alone. She's gonna live for two more years. A doctor took care of her husband and started taking her out. 

RL:
[Gasp] Uh-oh. 

IC:
And Paul remembers that, so we're talking about 1974, husband died 1973, so Paul's wife and Paul's wife's mother were living together here. They would call Lorraine, Montague's mother, in Los Angeles. And sometimes they would go and visit her because she was left alone. 

RL: 0:58:30-0:58:33
Okay, so Lorraine went down there and lived in that house he left her? 

IC: 0:58:33-0:58:35
Yes, the parents actually-
The parents moved. 

RL: 0:58:35-0:58:37
Oh, they did go down there, yeah. 

IC: 0:58:37-0:58:56
In Los Angeles. They had an apartment complex. They were living in an apartment and managing their remaining home. There was also that property, right? They owned an apartment complex in San Fernando Valley. So that's another thing that she inherited. 

RL:
Oh. 

IC:
So she inherited a fortune. When the husband died, this doctor kept taking her out. And Paul remembered-

RL: 0:58:56-0:58:57
The husband's daughter? 

IC: 0:58:57-0:59:02
So no, no. So the doctor that took care of her, of Loraine's-

RL: 0:59:02-0:59:03
Oh, the doctor that took-

IC: 0:59:03-0:59:55
Yeah. Already when the husband was doing poorly, he was like, you know, paying attention to her. 

RL:
Yeah. 

IC:
Then the husband died and he started taking her to theater, dinners, and so on. And Paul remembered that on the phone, the niece was talking to the aunt in Los Angeles and after the conversation, remember, he was was saying "What's happening to aunt Lorraine?"
She tells me "I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love."

RL:
[Gasps]

IC:
Yes, so you can imagine what happened. By the time she died and by the way the doctor said that she needed some surgery. 

RL:
Oh no. 

IC:
And it's unclear that she really needed surgery. At a certain point she was doing poorly at the hospital. The niece and the niece's daughter went to see her and the doctor prevented her from seeing her. They had to hire a lawyer to be allowed to see her. 

RL:
Oh no! 

IC:
And then one week later she died. 

RL: 0:59:55-0:59:57
Oh, something fishy there. 

IC: 0:59:57-1:00:00
When they opened the will, try to guess what happened? 

RL: 1:00:00-1:00:02
She left it all to him. [Gasps]

IC: 1:00:02-1:00:04
And then he went to Canada. 

RL: 1:00:04-1:00:08
He went where? 

IC: 1:00:08-1:00:25
Canada. 

So there was a lawsuit going on for years and years in the end they got some of the money but most of the money, I mean she was declared able to, how do you say, when somebody's mind works. 

RL:
Sure. With a sound mind and body. 

IC:
So she signed documents in which she moved the property. 

RL: 1:00:25-1:00:32
She thought she loved him? 

DL:
I gotta stand up. 

RL:
Go ahead, stand up, walk around a little bit. He can't sit too long. 

IC: 1:00:32-1:00:39
I mean, I honestly, I only hope that at least she was happy. 

RL: 1:00:39-1:00:57
Yeah, I hope her last days were happy. What a shame. All that money. You know, Ivano, I've read the titles of his books. I don't even understand the titles of his books! He was so, what a brain that man had. 

IC: 1:00:57-1:01:00
Those papers, I mean, it's really hard for me to read his stuff in general. 

RL: 1:01:00-1:01:04
I'll be willing to bet he didn't even have to work for those grades. 

IC: 1:01:04-1:01:29
Probably. Also, something that probably helped him very much is that it looks like he had an amazing memory. 

RL:
Oh yeah. 

IC:
So that really helps you because you can easily... 

RL:
Sure it does. 

IC:
You read and you have it in your mind. Like for example, Ed... 

RL:
Barakatt? 

IC:
Barakatt? 

RL:
Barakatt. 

IC:
He was telling me this anecdote of like... So there was this, once a month there were meetings, I guess school meetings. 

RL: 1:01:29-1:01:30
School meetings, assemblies. 

IC: 1:01:30-1:02:24
Assemblies, yeah. So, and Richard would be the one playing the piano, entertaining, and so he was playing classical music. At a certain point, some of them went around and said, Richard, "Can you play some", -it's called boogie, boogie... 

RL:
Boogie woogie? 

IC:
Boogie woogie! 

RL:
[Laughs]

IC:
And he looked at them, he smiled, and and he said Ivano, without any problem, without any music-

RL:
Yeah, no music. 

IC:
-he started playing by ear and it was wonderful. So the people, later when he went to graduate school in Berkeley, for all six years he was in Berkeley, he always had a job as an organist and choir director in the main congregation in the Bay Area. And I know, I found the records of how much he was paid. He was paid more than as a graduate student. So he had two jobs. And so I found the son of one of the pastors that hired him, and he said, you know, "Richard was amazing. He would never read music. He would not have anything in front of him."
He would just know like-

RL: 1:02:24-1:02:39
What a loss what a loss that was to the world I know you know to the world. 

IC:
I know, I know. 

RL:
What time are you meeting with Mary? 

IC:
At four. 

RL:
Four, okay. 

IC:
So-

RL:
You'll get you'll get information because they were in his class. 

IC:
No I'm totally looking forward, but you were fantastic because-

RC:
I wish my sister were here she could talk to to you. 

IC: 1:02:39-1:02:48
You have a knowledge of St. Mary that nobody else has. 

RL:
Well, I've been there... this is my [tapping finger] 49th year, Ivano. 

IC:
Congratulations. 

RL: 1:02:48-1:02:54
49. I'm shooting for 50 and then I'm going to say sayonara. Arrivederci. 

IC: 1:02:54-1:02:55
You believe her? 

RL: 1:02:55-1:03:29
Oh yeah. 

IC:
I don't. 

RL:
I think 50's enoughhh. 

DL:
I hope so, though. It keeps her out of my hair. 

[Laughter]

RL:
It was so good to see you. 

IC:
Thank you, thank you very much. 

DL:
Nice meeting you. 

IC: 1:03:29-1:03:31
Congratulations for the achievement in August. Enjoy the trip. I'm so jealous. Enjoy it. 

DL:
My brother lives over there. 

IC:
Yeah, enjoy the trip. Enjoy it. 

RL:
My brother says he can live there, he can never live here. With his social security and a little pension. He can make never it here, he can make it there. 

IC:
Those areas are still affordable. 

RL: 1:03:31-1:03:33
His rent is very, very reasonable. 

IC:
And the quality of life is still very good. 

DL:
[Unintelligible.]

RL: 1:03:33-1:03:40
Oh yeah, he was a very successful lawyer. 

DL:
He went through two marriages. 

RL:
Two marriages, two divorces. They cleaned him out. 

DL:
They cleaned him out. 

IC:
[Unintelligble]

DL: 1:03:49-1:03:52
He made a lot of money. 

RL: 1:03:52-1:04:01
And both he and my son say, the living in Italy is slow, nobody rushes, no traffic jams. 

[Audio quality here is worse so it's hard to pick up some turns. The three continue talking about the upcoming trip to Italy, Ivano's plans for getting the book finished, and his accomodations while staying in the Bay Area]
