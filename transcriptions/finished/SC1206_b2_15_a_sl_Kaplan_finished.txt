1995, when one of the UCLA faculty left to meet David Campbell to do an interview with him, for Tarski and Tarski's relationship to Conant and to Frank DeMau.
Frank DeMau had to ask for Maria Rathbouw [unintelligible].
[Audio cuts]
You've been saying to people that who you want is necessary---
I'm turning this on.

AK:
I don't mind.

AF:
That who you want is necessary or to your program.

AK: 0:00:40-0:02:10
I think, you know, there's this line.
I think it's from C.P. Snow actually, in one of those early novels about bureaucrats and academics, you know, scientists, and so on.
And one of the bureaucrats says, it's a famous line now, I'm not sure who it's from, that, you know, 80% of it is being there.


AF:
Is being there.

AK:
Showing up at all the meetings.
But that showing up at all the meetings, that's a kind of relentlessness, right?
That you don't kind of show up at the meeting and make a big pitch for your thing and people say no, and then you just don't show up at the meetings anymore.
You're always there, you've always got your agenda, you never give up on your agenda, and so on.
Now, if you deal with your agenda in a stupid way, if you yourself have no credibility, and so on, then of course, you can be as relentless as you wish, but pretty soon you'll be a pest, and people won't answer your phone calls, and they'll throw you out of their office and so on.
On the other hand, it makes a difference.
If you could get people, you know, you keep pursuing it and you get people to agree, "Look, I'd like to, I don't have the resources."
Okay, I understand, but you know, how about a half an appointment?
You know, you just keep...
People respond to pressure.

AF: 0:02:10-0:02:12
They do.
I think the biggest problem...

AK: 0:02:12-0:02:22
They're women, they're young women.
I remember reading this, I thought to myself, yeah, that's how life is, right?
"I didn't want to go out with him.
He just kept asking me and asking me and asking me."
You know?
And so finally, she really wanted to go out with him.

AF: 0:02:22-0:03:42
Right, and then she didn't want to sleep with him.

AK:
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
And he kept pushing and pushing and pushing.


AF:
I don't mind, and so you say, what's the big deal?

AK:
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, no, that's really true.
Human nature.

AF:
So there's a couple special things I want to ask you about, aside from sort of general questions.
And one is, but let me, so I'll just tell you, but don't answer those yet.
I want to ask you about, for you to tell me as much as you know about Tarski's relationship with Carnap, and also, well, maybe you'll think of something.
And also with Reichenbach, if you know anything about that.
And also whether you were here in 67 when Tarski was here, were you here at that time?
These are just things to float in your mind for a few minutes.
And also whether you were here, whether you were at the Carnap Memorial and you heard what Tarski said there, whether you remember at the Carnap Memorial and you heard what Tarski said there, whether you remember anything about that.
Because there's, just let it sit.
But then, so those are kind of background things I want to get to.
But just tell me when you first saw Tarski and what your impressions were.

AK: 0:03:44-0:03:57
I have a dreadful memory.
Things happen that are important and my wife says, "You don't remember when your son did so and so?"
No, I actually don't remember anything.


AF:
Well, just tell me what you do remember.

AK:
I'm sorry about that.
Don is the person to talk to.

AF: 0:03:57-0:04:00
Well, I will.
He's got notes and he's going to, you know, I'm going to talk to him.

AK: 0:04:00-0:04:01
He also has a very good memory.

AF: 0:04:01-0:04:08
Yeah, right.
So just even just when you were aware of him as a figure.

AK: 0:04:12-0:04:16
Yeah, I mean I was an undergraduate probably.

AF: 0:04:16-0:04:18
You were an undergraduate here?

AK: 0:04:18-0:04:39
Yeah, probably I was still an undergraduate.
See I was an undergraduate.


AF:
And you were Carnap's student?

AK:
I was in Reichenbach's...
I met Renee, my wife, in a lower division class at Reichenbach's.
I came here, I was a music major, and Don's then-wife, Veronica, was a counselor.
You know, was 51.


AF:
So long as that, 51?

AK: 0:04:40-0:04:41
Yeah. And...

AF: 0:04:41-0:04:44
And Veronica was a counselor at UCLA?

AK: 0:04:44-0:05:26
Yeah.
She had just been pressed into service to counsel incoming students because you know, that's when the universities were booming and they just didn't have enough people to deal with.
Okay, so I came here.
I was interested in jazz I wasn't interested in anything else and you know, there was the you know, the admissions counselor and you know scientist she said, you know---

AF:
That was Veronica?

AK:
Veronica, yeah.

AF:
Lucky you!

AK:
---and she said, "well what do you want to take?"
I said, "I don't know, I'm not much interested in anything" and she said, "You ought to take this course my husband teaches in logic", she said, "It's fantastic".
She was a big fan and I said, well, I hadn't done much mathematics.
I hadn't done anything.

AF: 0:05:26-0:05:29
Yeah, yeah.
Where'd you gone to high school?

AK: 0:05:29-0:07:00
In Pasadena.
And I wasn't admitted when I applied.


AF:
You were that bad.

AK:
Yeah, I was that bad.
They admitted me on probation.
They admitted me on probation, sort of.
I had to go to junior college in the summer before and prove I was capable of doing college.
So I kind of drifted in and she said, "oh yes", I said, "well I don't know, logic, what do you have to know as a background?
You know, oh you have to know some mathematics, you have to know this?"
She said nothing, you have to know nothing.
It's just pure reasoning and you know, it's a ground up subject, you know, no prerequisites of knowledge in any kind.
I said that's for me my bad memory, you know, so I could process, I just can't hold data. (Yeah okay)
So I got into this course and I got very interested in logic 

AF:
It was a big class?

AK:
No it was a small class.
He was using a book, an old logic book.
It was not [copy, ???, 6:30--seems like it's the name of a logician], it was something before that.
I can't remember what it was.
It was about 25 or 30 students, right?
But there was Reichenbach here and Don.
And Don was a fanatic then, just as he always has been, about logic.
There was a little logic group of graduate students that were all into logic.
Hillary was just leaving, sort of, as I was coming in.
But Wes Salmon was here and other guys like that.
So I got into that logic class.
And I was interested in nothing but logic.

AF: 0:07:00-0:07:01
It really got you.

AK: 0:07:01-0:07:03
Yeah, it really got me.

AF: 0:07:03-0:07:13
What got you?
You know, because I'm writing this for a popular, you know, my books are not written as, and I really like it...

AK: 0:07:13-0:08:00
I think a part of what appeals to me about the subject, and this is what I say to my students when I teach this course now, it may be due to my own particular deficiencies, but it is definitely what it feels to me about it, is that it's a ground-up subject.
And everybody in class, I say, all the students in class, as well as myself, in a certain way, we're all as well equipped, one another, you know, to think about logic, you know, and systems of reasoning.
I have some things to explain to them historically, how things have been done, and so on.
It's just something very attractive to me.

AF: 0:08:00-0:08:03
What do you mean by ground up?
I've never heard anybody use that expression.

AK: 0:08:03-0:08:26
You don't need to start out by already knowing.


AF:
You don't need a background.

AK:
You don't need a background in mathematics.
You don't have to be able to do algebra.
You don't have to be able to do arithmetic.
You don't have to know how to write.
You don't have to know a lot about literary style.
You don't have to know when the War of 1812 was fought.


AF: 0:08:26-0:08:27
Oh, ground up.
I get it.
I thought you meant ground up.

AK: 0:08:27-0:08:27
No, no, no, no.

AF: 0:08:27-0:08:29
From the ground up.
Yeah, right?

So, like, we all walk in...

AF: 0:08:35-0:08:36
From the ground up.

AK: 0:08:36-0:10:05
Yeah.
It's like the linguist's question of whether a certain double embedding is "good" in English, you know, is syntactically correct in English.
And, you know, we're all native speakers.
And your native speaker's intuition as to whether it sounds right to you, it's as good as the linguist's intuition, right?
So we're all reasoners, right?
I mean, I'm older than they are, so I've been reasoning longer, but, you know, I've been deteriorating longer too.
We've all spent our life reasoning and we've all spent our life doing logic.
Trying to think logically and think, and so on.


AF:
But here's how they do it through symbols...

AK:
And now we're going to try to formalize that process right but the question of whether we're getting it right or not is just "Does this seem okay to you?"

So that was one thing I just found hugely attractive that it was we were reasoning about reasoning.
And you didn't need to know what Leibniz had said about reasoning and what Descartes had said about reasoning and what Kant had said about reasoning in order to do it.
It was from the ground up.
So that's one thing that I found very very attractive about it.
Okay the second thing is I liked the kind of formalization of it.

AF: 0:10:05-0:10:07
Maybe that was because of your music interest?

AK: 0:10:07-0:11:07
I don't know.
It's hard for me to know.
But I have a slightly obsessive personality.
And I liked the idea in our reasoning about reasoning.
I liked the idea of squeezing all of the gray area out.
You know, just finding gray area, gray area, and just squeezing it out, right?
And that's what you do when you formalize, you know.
It reduces it to a kind of syntactical, you know, a sort of syntactical effort.
So I find that very pleasing, you know, from the kind of, that kind of obsessive desire for exactness.
(Right. Right.) And another thing I liked was I enjoyed the challenge of working within a formal system, right?
That's like liking mathematics, right?
(Yeah, yeah.)
But I had not liked mathematics before.

AF: 0:11:07-0:11:09
That's what's interesting.

AK: 0:11:09-0:11:43
What I liked about this was, you know, that it wasn't...
For me, I don't like to play games.
I mean this in a literal sense, not the metaphorical sense which most people mean.
I'm not a game player.
There was a period in my life when I had friends and I used to play poker on a fairly regular basis.
I sort of enjoyed playing poker because poker is really human relations.
Poker is a psychological game.
It isn't...

AF: 0:11:43-0:11:46
So you do like to play games, the other kind?

AK: 0:11:46-0:12:37
Well, I like to interact with people.
I like administration, and I like politics.
Right?
And poker is in a way more like politics, you know, than it is like bridge.
Yeah.
But I don't play bridge.
No chess.
I've played a little chess, you know, from time to time but you know it's not you know, I don't do crossword puzzles.
There's a lot of things like that that people like to do that are games that I don't have any interest in it.
I mean in the end it's come to it, it's nothing.
I mean, okay, so you work your way through them.
I don't like to play computer games.
You know, so you work your way through the maze and you shut down the blah, blah, blah.
So you've killed a half an hour, right?

AF: 0:12:37-0:12:40
So you like, but you like the formalization.

AK: 0:12:40-0:16:45
But I liked, and a lot of mathematics had seemed to me to have a game playing quality to it.
But the thing about logic is it's this ground up thing.
It's very foundational.
You know what you're doing.
It isn't artificial.
It's not like doing group theory.
A group is an algebraic structure that's arbitrarily defined.
And okay, then you prove theorems about it.
And to me, that's game playing.

But when what you're doing is... I mean, I think if I had been a mathematician, I mean, I'm not that talented at mathematics, and I'm not very talented at science, generally speaking.
But if I had been a mathematician, I would have been a mathematical physicist or something like that.
I mean, I want to be doing something not just sheerly for the sake of the sport, right?
I want to be doing it in order to get some deeper understanding of something else that's important to me.

And I think people that do set theory and people that, I think there's people that do logic or have that, they feel they're at something foundational that's very important that has to do with thought, and it's kind of connected with philosophy in that way, in a way in which some other branches of mathematics are not.
Mathematical physics is connected in that way with understanding really how the world works, right?
Number theory is, I mean, it's a fascinating subject, I suppose, but it seems like a game to me.

So that's the second thing that I liked, or third thing that I liked about it.
And the other thing was that there was Don's fantastic enthusiasm and his remarkable teaching skills.
And there was a social group that I could attach myself to.
Don held his office hours at that time in the cafeteria annex of the student union.
And there was a big table there, it was all old furniture.
This was early post-war, when the physical facilities were not yet ready for all the people that were coming back to school and so on.
And there was one big, huge table there that was just known, it was the logic table, and Don held his office hours there and hung out there as much of the time as he could, and the TAs held office hours there and hung out there, and you could go to that table almost any time of the day or night.
And there would be some people around there doing some kind of logic.
I mean, maybe graduate students doing important things or Don or someone or maybe some undergraduates doing it.
And it had a very important social function for me.
It had a very important social function for me.

And Don sort of took me up as a pet.
I was a teacher's pet kind of freshman student, and so I was brought into an exciting high life.
Don's a very exciting personality.
I mean, he was married, but there were lots of women floating around him and he had big parties at his house.
I was an 18 year old from Pasadena.
So all that kind of brought me into the subject.

So I became a kind of teacher's pet, went through the logic courses.
In my second year, I took an inductive logic course from Reichenbach, who was a different kind of teacher.
And this was a course in which Reichenbach was teaching inductive logic.
And he talked about the Bruno Hauptmannd Lindbergh baby kidnapping case.
Right?
The so-called crime of the century.
People now say OJ Simpson is the crime of the century.
It's just that there's more media now than there was then,
but that was a big...

AF: 0:16:45-0:16:49
And he talked about that case.

AK: 0:16:49-0:18:01
He talked about that case as an example of inductive evidence.
And he talked about Sherlock Holmes.
There were like 150 or 200 students in that class, right.
Don's real logic class had like 20 students.

And I met Renee in that class, actually.
I had a girlfriend who was a girlfriend of hers, and they introduced us, and, you know.

The next term, I think it was after that, Reichenach was teaching an upper division course on his Foundation's of Probability book.
So that was a serious probability course.
Actually, Renee got an A in that course, and I got a C, although Renee and I had studied together so that I could help her.
And the TAs talked Reichenbach into raising my grade from a C to a B because they said, "You can't give him a C, he's the best logic student in the department."
So he raised my grade.
But the next term, there was this serious upper division course and I went into that course.
And Reichenbach died during that term.

AF: 0:18:01-0:18:03
He died and then when?
When did he die?

AK: 0:18:03-0:18:27
I can't put the year...

AF:
53? If that was your third year-

AK:
Yeah but I may have the years wrong, right?
So he died it was 52 or 53, this is a fact right I mean you'll be able to track it down.
Okay. And he died like early on in the semester and the department hired Richard Montague to come down and finish the course.

AF: 0:18:27-0:18:29
That's what happened?
Richard came in the middle of the year?

AK: 0:18:29-0:19:05
Yeah, that's when Richard came.
He came in the middle of the year.
Now, check this with Don because I may have a false memory of it.
Again, I was 19 years old or something, but that was my sense.
Okay.
And Richard Montague came down.
I mean, he was a stunning personality.
You knew Richard well.
In a way, that was my introduction to Tarski.
Richard and Richard talked about Tarski all the time.
Don had talked a little bit about Tarski.
Don had met Richard by taking a sabbatical or something.

AF: 0:19:05-0:19:09
Don was in Berkeley.
I think Don was a student in Berkeley.

AK: 0:19:09-0:19:11
Yeah, that's right.
Don got his degree in Berkeley.

AF: 0:19:11-0:19:33
Right.
And so that's one of the reasons I want to talk to Don.
He was there really early.
He saw Tarski.
I think he and [Mates, ???, 19:20] were contemporaries.
And he saw Tarski when Tarski, you know, either very shortly after Tarski arrived.
Tarski arrived in Berkeley in 42.
So I'm hoping he'll have...

AK: 0:19:33-0:19:35
Yeah, that's probably right.
That's probably right.

AF: 0:19:35-0:19:47
I know Mates was there by 40, [Mates] was there by 45, because [Mates] actually saw Tarski's family arrive from Poland, went to the train station.

AK: 0:19:47-0:19:48
Oh my goodness.

AF: 0:19:48-0:19:50
It was very nice. So..

AK: 0:19:50-0:20:09
So Don had gone back up on a sabbatical or something because it was his spiritual home, he loved being at Berkeley.
And there he'd run into I guess Richard Montague and Dana Scott probably, Richard and Dana.
You know the two Enfants, the Enfant Terrible and Oncle Dana, who I'm sure was Oncle Dana even when he was 18 years old.

AF: 0:20:09-0:20:11
Not really.
No.

AK: 0:20:11-0:20:15
I remember Dana when he was pretty young.
He was nothing like Richard.

AF: 0:20:15-0:20:18
No, they were different, but they were very close.

AK: 0:20:18-0:20:29
Yeah, yeah, they were.
But Dana always had a sense of being slightly older than he was, and Richard always younger than he was, although Richard was very young.

AF: 0:20:29-0:20:33
Richard was hysterical, and Dana has a sort of a mad, like mad...

AK: 0:20:33-0:20:35
Yeah, that's right.
He's sort of...

AF: 0:20:35-0:20:36
Right, right.

AK: 0:20:36-0:20:41
So, Don pushed to get Richard brought down.
He had met Richard, went to replace Reichenbach.

AF: 0:20:41-0:20:42
So that was Don's idea.

AK: 0:20:42-0:20:47
Yeah, that's my understanding of it.

AF: 0:20:47-0:20:50
I'll ask Don about that.
Richard appears in the middle of your semester.

AK: 0:20:50-0:20:52
And starts and takes over.

AF: 0:20:52-0:20:54
How did it go?

AK: 0:20:54-0:22:22
Reichenbach had been kind of working his way through his book and so on.
It had been kind of interesting.
I was doing my best to keep up.
It wasn't exciting to me.
And then Richard arrives, and Richard starts pointing out that none of the theorems in this book have proofs.
They're not proved.
They're not theorems.
There's missing hypotheses.
It's all wrong, technically, right?
And he starts having people in the class, put, okay, now we're just, "Reichenbach told you, okay, there's this theorem, and this shows so and so, and you can see the proof if there's any questions about it, blah, blah, blah.
And then this, and we're moving along, and so on."
And Richard said, O"kay, now, you know, Mr. Kaplan, you know, next week, you know, I want you to prove, you know, theorem 43."
I said, "Well, the theorem 43, the proof is in the text."
I said, already.
He said, "Okay, it's okay.
You put it on the board, you know, there may be-" sorry.
So then you get up there, you start putting the proof on.
You know, he says, "Well, how do you get from step three to four?"
Well, there's a gap, it turns out.
And so we slowly discover under Richard's tutelage what a proof is.
That was extremely interesting.

AF: 0:22:22-0:22:24
Was it threatening in any way?
Was it at all intimidating?

AK: 0:22:27-0:22:32
I loved Richard.
Richard was a difficult person to get along with.

AF: 0:22:32-0:22:36
Tarski would have people come to the board and they...

AK: 0:22:36-0:22:40
I think Tarski tortured people.

AF: 0:22:40-0:22:44
Yeah, well he didn't torture people, he just...
I mean he didn't do it to torture people.
He did it to insist that things were done right.

AK: 0:22:44-0:23:07
Yeah, and this was Richard, this was clearly Richard imitating Tarski.
That's exactly what he was doing and he wanted to get the point across that a proof is a proof not some connected lines you know. It's not like by trying to you know to prove to you that we really ought to go to the movies tonight, you know, together.

AF: 0:23:07-0:23:11
Did people fall apart under this when Richard did it?

AK: 0:23:11-0:23:19
No, I don't think so.
I think it was refreshing in many ways and so on.
I think throughout Richard's career he followed this pattern.
It was hard on some people.

AF: 0:23:19-0:23:21
Yeah, it was hard on some people.

AK: 0:23:21-0:23:27
And it was good on some people.
It was hard on some people.
And it was good on other people.

AF: 0:23:27-0:23:32
Yeah, well I think that was the case with Tarski, so I'm trying to see how close this was.

AK: 0:23:32-0:23:37
I think it's a method, and I think it's going to have the same consequences no matter who you do it with.

AF: 0:23:37-0:23:49
Yeah.
No, it's more like who's doing it.
I wondered if Richard had a softened version of Tarski or if he was a clone.
That's all I'm trying to get at.

AK: 0:23:49-0:24:15
Well, Richard did not have, in some ways...
He was imitating Tarski, I have no doubt about that.
He did not have, in a certain way, Tarski's majesty.
And I think that would be more threatening and more intimidating.
I mean, he was probably like 20 years old at the time.

AF:
He was older than that!

AK:
Well, 25 maybe.
He was pretty young.

AF: 0:24:15-0:24:26
I don't think he was any younger, for example, than Sol.
He just looked young.

AK:
So how old would he have been?

AF:
Well, he had his PhD by then, right?

AK: 0:24:26-0:24:30
No, no, no, that's another story.

AF:
No, he didn't have his PhD?

AK:
No, he did not.

AF: 0:24:30-0:24:37
He got his PhD, I think he got his PhD in 1956 or something like that.

AK: 0:24:37-0:24:40
Well, this must have been way before.
It must have been like 1952.

AF: 0:24:40-0:24:44
Well, it couldn't have been 1952 if you came in 1951.
This is your third year here.

AK: 0:24:44-0:24:47
No, I think it was my second year.
It could have been my second year.
It could well have been my second year.

AF: 0:24:47-0:24:49
So, in other words, he was still a graduate student.

AK: 0:24:49-0:24:52
Yeah.
So, how old was he when he got his PhD?

AF: 0:24:52-0:25:11
I'm assuming he's as old as Sol was.
Sol had two years out.
Sol was in the Army for two years.
Sol got his PhD when he was 28 or 29.

AK:
I'll be Richard wasn't older than 25.

AF:
He could have been 25.

AK: 0:25:11-0:25:42
I'll bet he wasn't.
A 25-year-old who's shown up as a temporary fill-in, as a temporary fill-in, For Reichenbach.
Yeah, as a temporary fill-in, right?
Who didn't have a PhD, right?
He just can't do to people.
He can't get away with doing to people.
He can't intimidate people in the way in which, you know, and so on.
So I think later on, as Richard became more famous and further on, I think he was in some ways harder on students.

AF: 0:25:42-0:25:44
So he was, he picked up on this thing.

AK: 0:25:44-0:25:48
Yeah, he did.
And there were some students that really couldn't handle it.

AF: 0:25:48-0:26:04
Yeah, well there were Tarski students who couldn't handle it.

AK:
Who just couldn't handle it.

AF:
I mean, there are people in seminar who, I've had descriptions of people.
I mean, sometimes Tarski would be helpful, but sometimes what he had was an insistence on things being said in a very precise way in his system.

AK: 0:26:04-0:26:05
Right, yeah.

AF: 0:26:05-0:26:10
And if it wasn't said that way, you weren't permitted to go the next step.

AK: 0:26:10-0:26:17
That's right.
That's exactly right.
He did exactly the same thing.
And I'll tell you something.
That's not my style.

AF: 0:26:17-0:26:19
No.

AK: 0:26:20-0:26:45
But I feel that with the loss of Richard, and with the loss of Tarski in a way, we have really lost something of immense value.
I mean, because to me, even though I wouldn't have done it that way, and I wouldn't teach that way, and I don't teach that way, but it was a shining example of idealized... something.

AF: 0:26:48-0:26:50
It's like- It's an insistence on a standard.

AK: 0:26:50-0:27:31
Yeah, it's an insistence, an absolute insistence on a standard.
And it's just very healthy to have that around.
It's like having a moral hero sort of around.
You think, I wouldn't want to live my life that way, you know, but there's that person and it helps you to calibrate your own behavior.
You can sort of calibrate your own behavior by them.
So I thought that was quite wonderful.

AF:
Yeah.
Well, at any rate-

AK:
Tarski, I think Tarski did torture Richard.
That was my sense was that Tarski would not—Richard wanted to get a Ph.D., and Tarski would not let Richard get a Ph.D.

AF: 0:27:31-0:27:35
He did that to everybody.
He wasn't specific to Richard.

AK: 0:27:35-0:29:33
I see.
Now, again, this is a 19 or 20-year-old kid, getting it through lots of filters and not very psychologically sophisticated.
But my sense was that Tarski used people, he used his students, and he used them as much as he was able to.
And there were some students that he couldn't get away with very much with.
I mean, I'm talking all about brilliant students.
And there are some that he couldn't do it.
I mean, he could go so far and they weren't going to do it.
And there were others that were somehow, whatever their internal personality, they were more compliant.
They wanted to please the master more.
And their relationship to him as being his favorite whatever, it was like Bertrand Russell had these secretaries at a certain stage in life.
Or it's like some, if you'll forgive me, some women that attach themselves to the great figure and their life is just in the service.
My sense was that Richard was one of those people that Tarski sensed, he could keep him dangling just about as long as he wanted to.
And Tarski had no compassion, no sense of honor, no sense of, you know...
Your kids grow up, I remember Renee saying to me at one point when our son was 15 years old or something.
She took me aside and she said, you know, "You can't talk to him that way anymore."
I mean, I'm not a nasty person.
I wasn't talking in an insulting way, but I was very-

AF: 0:29:33-0:29:34
Being the father.

AK: 0:29:34-0:30:30
Yeah.
She said, you have to make a change now.
And I did.
I mean, she's right about all these things.
And my sense was that Tarski would make the change not at the point at which it was called for, he would make it when he couldn't get away with it any longer.
And so long as he could remain in despotic power and authority, he was gonna sit there and run things his own way.
No consideration for the human development or the growth or the independence or the autonomy of the person.
And Richard, for whatever elements it was in his personality, was prepared to play the brilliant child, the good child, the apple of the eye, the whatever, the good servant.

AF: 0:30:30-0:30:37
How did he get out of it?
How did he eventually get...
Because I know different stories about different people.

AK: 0:30:37-0:30:55
I actually don't know, but he wanted to get his PhD and Tarski just wouldn't let him get his PhD.

AF:
This is not unusual.

AK:
Yeah, he had to do more and more and more.
Okay.
And I think Don worked on it.
I think everyone in the department.
Don might know what caused it to happen.

AF: 0:30:55-0:30:56
What made it finally happen.

AK: 0:30:56-0:31:14
Yeah, to happen at the end.
But I'm sure that the whole department, at a certain point, the department as a whole was putting whatever administrative pressure that they could.
I don't myself think that he would pay a hell of a lot of...

AF: 0:31:14-0:32:14
Oh, he did.
Now, finally, for example, in Sol's case, I think Tarski was away for a year.
Sol had a thesis.
He had a....
It wasn't something that terribly interested Tarski.
It was in a direction that Tarski had not suggested.
Tarski was away for a year and he worked with Henkin.
Tarski came back and here was this result.
Tarski said, well, "I don't know about that."
And more not quite what it ought to be.
And finally, what he agreed was to send it to Mostowski.
And a little closer.
And Mostowski put his stamp of approval and said "This is extremely interesting work."
That's how that worked.
In Dana's case, Dana simply left over flunkyism.
There was a situation where he and Richard were flunkies on a particular thing.
And then Richard went to UCLA, so then Dana was left as the...

AK: 0:32:14-0:32:16
Oh, Dana had to carry all the flunky duties.

AF: 0:32:16-0:32:18
All the flunky part.
So there was there something...

AK: 0:32:18-0:32:22
Do you think that Dana and Sol are the same age?

AF: 0:32:22-0:32:26
Dana's younger.
But Dana's younger than Richard.
Dana was uniquely young.

AK: 0:32:26-0:32:46
Was Dana younger than Richard?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's right.
Of course.

AF:
Dana came as an undergraduate and was immediately projected.

AK:
Yeah, like he was 18 years old and in graduate school or something like that.
Yeah, I remember that.


AF:
He was an undergraduate, but he was already in the graduate class.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah.) That's why.

AK:
That's right.
I mean, that's part of the thing that makes one susceptible to flunkyism.
Right.
You're only 18 years old

AF: 0:32:50-0:33:01
You see what happened with Dana is that he just couldn't do it.
It wasn't that he, well the way the story goes is he didn't he just was supposed to do something and he wasn't refusing to do it, but he just wasn't able to bring himself to do it.
I mean, that's the way he tells the story

AK: 0:33:02-0:33:04
Some flunky task, is what you mean.

AF: 0:33:04-0:33:33
Yeah.
They were supposed to translate something.
I know what it is, but I don't have it in my mind.
And Richard left, and so Dana was left to do it by himself.
At least when he was doing it with Richard, maybe it was a little bit of fun, but by himself?
And so he just didn't do it, and Tarski kept saying, "Well, well, well?" and finally Dana said, "Well, I haven't got it done."
And Tarski just blew up.
And Dana just figured the only way he could get out of it was to get out of there.
And so he ended up, he left the workshop.
So that's another thing-

AK: 0:33:33-0:33:37
And he went to Princeton and got his degree from Church or something.

AF: 0:33:37-0:33:48
But actually, the problem was a problem that Tarski suggested.
So in a sense, he's almost like a student of Tarski, but he didn't have to have Tarski sign the thesis.
But I mean, I can cite you 10 stories.

AK: 0:33:48-0:34:02
Well, one story after another.


AF:
Yeah, I want to hear.
But it is interesting.

AK:
Yeah, that's interesting.
(Yeah.)
You know, I never understood.
I mean, his son is a logician.

AF:
No, his son is not.

AK:
Oh, it's his son-in-law.
It's his son-in-law.

AF: 0:34:02-0:34:09
Yeah, Aaron Floyd.

AK:
Aaron Floyd.

AF:
His son is a physicist.
His son is a physicist.
Now, that's another big problem.

AK: 0:34:09-0:34:13
I mean, I can't imagine.
He has a daughter also, right?
How is she?

AF: 0:34:13-0:34:17
She's fine.
But I'm not going to tell you all those things.

AK: 0:34:17-0:34:19
Because you don't have a story to tell.
I mean, I thought to myself, as I was seeing-

AF: 0:34:19-0:34:27
I'll tell you this much.
He was a terrible father.
He was an impossible father.

AK: 0:34:27-0:34:30
I had the feeling he could be an okay father to a daughter.

AF: 0:34:30-0:34:31
No, to neither.

AK: 0:34:31-0:34:35
Although he wouldn't be very good.
But to a son, I thought he would be death.

AF: 0:34:35-0:34:36
Impossible.

AK: 0:34:36-0:34:39
You know, the kid would have to get out of there.

AF: 0:34:39-0:34:44
Well, he did.
He did.
But he would come back to visit and he couldn't stay more than 15 minutes because there would be an explosion.
To the very end.

AK: 0:34:44-0:34:46
Yeah, I can imagine that.

AF: 0:34:46-0:34:52
To the very end.
But now what's fascinating is now he's his father's son.
Now he's his father's son.

AK: 0:34:52-0:34:53
You mean he behaves?
Is that what you mean?

AF: 0:34:53-0:35:12
Yeah, he looks like him, he acts like him, and he's undertaken to arrange all his papers.
There's a new edition of the [Marhides, ???, 35:00] Group that Oxford published that came out where he wrote the preface.
He's still looking for a job, but he's become the good son that he could be.

AK: 0:35:12-0:35:14
When his father was alive.

AF: 0:35:14-0:35:24
Taking on that role.
It's just amazing how much like him he looks and behaves.
He's not as nasty as Tarski could be.

AK: 0:35:24-0:36:26
Tarski had other women that he was involved in also, wasn't he?
Younger women.


AF:
Lots of women, yeah.

AK:
I thought he was quite a good-looking man.


AF:
You thought Tarski was a good-looking man?
Oh, really?

AK:
I didn't think he was handsome.
I mean, he's not Cary Grant handsome.
But there's a kind of compact spiffiness about him.
I even thought he almost like a bit of a dandy.
I mean, he was, I mean, they were smoking his little cigarette, very European looking.
Features, not handsome features, you know, Polish Jewish kind of features.
But he held himself.
His body language was rather commanding.
He didn't slouch.
I mean, there was the precision in all things.
In all his movements, yeah.
I mean, in his demeanor, he dressed nicely.

AF: 0:36:26-0:36:45
Now what about his stature?
In his stature, I mean, lots of people, first thing they say about him is that he was short.
Did that strike you or not?

AK:
Yeah, Richard was short too.

AF:
Yeah, no, Richard's not on...
There are certain people who make that their first explanation for why he behaved the way he did.
Others not.

AK: 0:36:45-0:36:47
Oh, as to why he behaved?

AF: 0:36:47-0:36:49
Napoleonic, you know, type of thing.

AK: 0:36:49-0:36:50
Oh, because he was a short person?

AF: 0:36:50-0:36:58
Because of his stature.
Others not.
And I'm just curious.
It's almost like I'm taking a census.
It sounds like this was not the first thing you brought up.

AK: 0:36:58-0:37:01
I don't have an explanation.
I mean...

AF: 0:37:01-0:37:06
I mean, you didn't think of him as short first.
That's not your first thing.

AK: 0:37:06-0:37:14
You have to understand, my contacts with him were very, very few.
And very, very remote.
And I was very, very young.

AF: 0:37:14-0:37:15
But you knew of him as a great man.

AK: 0:37:15-0:37:28
I knew of him as a great man.
And I remember the first time I saw him and heard him give a lecture.
And there was a party, I think, at Don's afterwards.
And he was there.
He had some young women with him, or buzzing around him, or whatever it was.

AF: 0:37:28-0:37:30
He was always the center of attention.

AK: 0:37:30-0:37:51
That's right.
But my sense of him, first of all, I mean, I thought of him as a bad person.


AF:
 You did?

AK:
Yeah.

AF:
Okay, why?

AK:
Because of the way he treated Richard.
I mean, a little dictator.
(Yeah.)
I guess I say a LITTLE dictator, right?
I mean, a tyrannical despot.
I mean, I had that sense.

AF: 0:37:51-0:37:54
So already Richard told you that or just because you saw, you observed that?

AK: 0:37:54-0:38:07
Just from what I'd heard in the stories about Richard and so on.
I don't remember Richard telling me, maybe from Don.
People were kind of afraid of him.
And I guess it was widely known that he was not a nice person.

AF: 0:38:07-0:38:10
Well, no, a lot of people thought he was extremely nice.
You know, depending on how he worked out-

AK: 0:38:10-0:38:20
You know, there were people, you know, [Bob Yost, ???] and Don Kalish talked about, there's a guy, [Marhinka, ???], Paul Marhinka, he used to teach philosophy.

AF: 0:38:20-0:38:21
He's not still around, is he?

AK: 0:38:21-0:38:22
I don't think he's still alive.

AF: 0:38:22-0:38:23
By the way, it's...

AK: 0:38:23-0:38:54
Who used to teach philosophy up at Berkeley.
(Yeah.)
And Don and Bob Yost were both very...
Bob Yost might have stories about, while you're down, here about Tarski.
Actually, Bob would have known about the department and hiring of Richard and the problems in trying to get the degree, but Don will know all about that.
(Yeah.)

Okay.
Marhinka was obviously a very rough person, rough on people, insulting and so on, but it was clear that Bob and Don at least, and probably Mates and others, loved him.

AF: 0:38:54-0:38:58
Mates loved Tarsky though.

AK: 0:38:58-0:39:10
Maybe that's true.
My sense was that lots of people respected, revered, lots of people revered him, but I didn't get a sense that anybody really loved him.

AF: 0:39:10-0:39:16
But I don't know "loved" him.
He said, Mates said that Tarski was always extremely good to him and extremely kind to him and never gave him any problems.

AK: 0:39:16-0:39:27
Anita, that's a completely different quality because Tarski never gave me any problems and he was respectful of me.

AF: 0:39:27-0:39:33
No, no, but Tarski was on his PhD committee and in fact he suggested Mates to [unintelligible] his thesis.

AK: 0:39:33-0:39:34
I see.
So this is the stoic logic stuff, was that it?

AF: 0:39:34-0:39:37
Yeah, but it was that Tarski proposed the problem.
(Yeah.) So it's not just incidental.

AK: 0:39:37-0:42:14
No, but there's another, there's something else.
There are some people who are such that others, others treat them, others treat them nicely.
[Phone ringing]
Treat nicely and respectfully and so on.
Even though some of these other people are monsters, but certain people are treated, and I happen to be one of those people.
And I know from the time I was young and I was traveling around and gave talks at places, I'd go someplace and everyone would say, "Oh, you know, so-and-so is there.
He's the most awful person.
Let me tell you stories about the horrible things he did and the way he treated people."
And I was always treated very nicely.
He took me to their home, and so on.
I was a bright kid, and so on.
There's something about me that's not cowed.

I think people that are despotic like that can sense the fear.
They can smell the fear in people.
And they can also smell in some other people that they can't do it.
And for the most part, these people, unless they're just crazy, raging wild men, lunatics, for the most part, these are people who are disciplined.
They're under, they know what they can do and they know what they can't and they do it when they can do it and they don't do it when they can't do it.

And you know, so the fact that he treated Mates well and so on, that's different from your really feeling a sense of warmth toward a person and really liking the person and having respect for someone as a human being.
You can revere them as an intellect.

Anyway, that was my sense of what the man he was.
You're talking about when I first saw him.
So I saw him as very, he was like a personification of this sense of elegant precision.
He dressed very nicely.
This is my view of him.
His clothes fit well.
He was well dressed.
I mean he wasn't the fop or anything like that.
He had a kind of, there was a kind of compact elegance to him.
I mean, it's true he was short, and he wasn't a graceful person.

AF: 0:42:14-0:42:18
He's always falling off the podium.
About to.

AK: 0:42:18-0:43:10
He wasn't kind of languid or graceful.
He was finely honed out of a block of solid marble.

You know, somebody said, once described the new Mercedes sports car as looking as if it had just been carved out of a single chunk of marble.
A little bit on the chunky side.
It's not a graceful car.
But you have that feeling of great solidity and all of the rest of it.

And he was there, kind of well put together.
He was slightly balding already.
But he had...
Take Paul Grice.
There's Paul Grice at one end, he was not a handsome man, and there's Tarski, also not a handsome man, at the other end.

AF: 0:43:10-0:43:12
Yeah, well Paul Grice was such a slob.

AK: 0:43:12-0:45:54
Yeah, but there was, see there was not a touch of that slobbiness in his-
Hi how are you?
I thought his physical appearance communicated that sense of, you know, nothing out of place, no gaps in the proof, and absolute precision, you know.
I'm sure he did get up one morning and think, "Oh, I'll part my hair on this side, I'll part it on this.
I don't have time to comb my hair this morning.
This morning I wouldn't shave.
Should I wear a tie?
No, maybe I won't wear a tie.
I don't know.
I'll wear a blue jean."
I'm sure he got up every morning and he got dressed in this way.


AF:
Yeah, exactly.

AK:
Yeah, it did exactly.
And that was a sense of being very well-honed, self-contained, and so on, smoking his little cigarettes and so on.

Another thing that got me is, of course this is a mathematical thing, but in philosophy lots of people read the papers.
He never read a paper.
There was also this incredible elegance of presentation, you know, the starting at the bottom, I mean, the wonderful, the foundation, the philosophical foundation, you know, for it.
No kind of jumping in, hey, "Here's an interesting problem, and so on, right?"
I mean, there was a reason why, I mean, you know, you could say what Tarski said, you know, "This is a serious problem and this is a serious person, or this is an interesting problem and that's not an interesting problem."
I mean, I had very much the sense that it wasn't subjective, like "I'm interested in this, I'm not interested in that", right?
He said, "This is interesting and here's why."
Yeah, but "Here's why."
And then he would explain to you why from the ground up, you know, I mean, because there's this, these are related to this, this is this, and now someone proved this interesting thing from here to here, you know, and so on.

And that's like what reading his work is like that, you know, I mean, it's just just so, the kind of simplicity and elegance and foundation, solid foundation, that explains why it is the definitions, beautiful definitions, the nominal definitions that are real definitions, the way the definition picked the species out, it just perfectly picked out a natural car.
It really knocked me out.
Richard was like that also.
Richard had a lot of those qualities.

AF: 0:45:54-0:46:01
I think a lot of people who were students picked up more or less than this.

AK: 0:46:03-0:46:18
I think that's right.
As I say, it's such a terrible loss not to have it around.
But people like that.
I don't know.
I think our intellectual standards deteriorate.

AF: 0:46:18-0:46:27
I'm going to pop out this lens, which is just too...
I'm just going to check it out.
I'm trying to blink it.

AK: 0:46:27-0:46:30
Don't you have to put it in something?

AF: 0:46:30-0:46:46
Well, I will.
I'll just hold it here for a minute and put it in something.
Don't want to stop talking.
So I'm going to go through my list of questions sort of quickly.
I know you didn't consider yourself a personal friend or even a colleague.
Did you consider yourself a colleague?

AK:
Not really.

[Recording ends.]
