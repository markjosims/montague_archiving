JT: 0:00:01-0:00:18
with my father's mind yes, and this was the reason why Urszula wanted very much to come to Berkeley in June for the Congress.
She came for the Congress on the Semiotics in Berkeley.
And then was able to stay until now.

AF: 0:00:19-0:00:28
Yeah, well I think that's true, that many Poles who have come to Berkeley have come because Tarski was there.

UT: 0:00:28-0:00:51
And many would [TALKS TO JAN IN POLISH]

JT:
Would like to-

AF:
Would still like to keep coming

UT:
To visit Berkeley because of the [TALKS TO JAN IN POLISH]

JT:
Because of the renown of that

AF: 0:00:55-0:01:13
It's sort of like coming to a holy place.
Like that?
You make a pilgrimage.
It's a pilgrimage, huh?
Yeah.
Sort of going to the source.
Wow, that's very interesting. That's very important actually.

UT:
This is true!

AF:
Yeah, it feels that way.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT
She says she's not exaggerating, it's true!

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT:
Because it's really the soul.

AF:
Yeah.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: 0:01:14-0:01:42
The reason, or... What stimulated her the most to come to Berkeley was just this magic of my father's name.

AF: 0:01:42-0:01:52
Okay, no, I absolutely believe that.
Yeah.
So there's no question in your mind, Tarski LIVES in Poland?
Is that right?

UT: 0:01:53-0:02:22
He lives in our memory, yes?

AF:
Yeah.

UT:
And not only memory, I mean everybody wants to have some papers, Tarski papers and know more about life.

JT:
About life?

UT:
About life, about life, Tarski life.

AF: 0:02:22-0:02:24
They want to know about it.


JT: 0:02:24-0:02:25
Yes, well, here we have a kind of authority [LAUGHS]

AF: 0:02:28-0:02:29
So I have a good market for my biography.
Yeah.

JT: 0:02:30-0:02:32
-who I'm sure knows more than myself [LAUGHS]

AF: 0:02:34-0:02:45
Well, by now, you know...

JT:
Not very likely.
I have ambition to overcome

AF:
The last...I wrote a biography of Jean Van Heijenoort.

JT: 0:02:45-0:02:45
I told you about this [UNINTELLIGIBLE].


AF: 0:02:46-0:03:40
Yeah.
Right.
And at a certain... And he was alive when I started writing it, so I was interviewing him.
In other words, I didn't know when I started that I was writing a biography.
I thought I was writing something short.
And so but I interviewed him and I interviewed him and then he had this very tragic death.
And then by that time I had a lot... But somewhere in the course of the interview, I interviewed him for three years, but then I interviewed other people that knew him and I started doing other research.
And at some point he started to say to me, "you know, you know more about me than I know about myself."

And in a certain way it was true because other people would tell me things about him, somebody else would say something about him with a different perspective.

JT:
The thing that he did not remember

AF:
Or else he didn't think that's the way he was, but they did.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

[RECORDING CUTS OUT AND BACK IN]

JT: 0:03:42-0:03:50
She would like to say one thing of a different kind knowing that we are all short of time.


AF: 0:03:50-0:03:50
Yeah.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: 0:03:53-0:06:10
When my father died, yes.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT:
It was kind of a universal mourning among the Polish logicians.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT:
They took this looked upon this as some kind of an undescribable loss.

AF:
Agreed, yes.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT:
Yes, it was really the beginning still the first two years of this state of war and somehow people felt that logicians, especially, that one important link that they had to United States somehow-

AF:
Had been cut.

JT:
-had been cut.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT:
Well, as you were saying, yes, that people started asking themselves "what will it be now with our logic after the without-"

AF:
Without Tarski. Well that's really interesting!

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT:
Those logicians whose work related directly to my father's work really felt this in a very personal way.

AF: 0:06:10-0:06:19
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's, that is interesting.
I'm glad that you added that.
Yeah, no.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: 0:06:24-0:06:54
Yes, there was great eagerness to write something about my father.

AF:
Yeah.

UT:
[TALKS IN POLISH]

JT:
So those who had some connections with the publishing business or with learners started looking around to see who's really worthy of writing about my father.


AF: 0:06:55-0:07:00
Right.
Yeah, right.
Well did they find?
Well, I guess Wolanski's written a lot.

JT:
Well, not directly.

AF:
Yeah, right.

JT: 0:07:00-0:07:19
Yeah.
Let me say that I wrote an article about my father for the tenth anniversary of his death.
It was requested, in fact, by "Polish language daily" in New York City and finally we could not find anything of mine afterwards. And I could not find a publisher.

AF: 0:07:19-0:07:20
Yeah.
Right.

JT: 0:07:20-0:07:34
And it went to be a [nomoski ??? 7:20] but it sort of got stuck there and I'm trying to find out I'm trying to withdraw it.
I don't get any answer on it.

AF:
That's it.
That's the way with publishers

JT:
[CROSSTALK] ...registered letters saying that, I mean, I don't agree to any further publications.

AF: 0:07:34-0:07:38
Right, yeah.
Yeah, that's maddening.
Yeah-

[RECORDING CUTS OUT AND BACK IN]


JT: 0:07:39-0:07:48
in the next few months you can well expect, and the first edition is planned for five hundred copies. [Uh-huh]
That's awfully few!

AF: 0:07:49-0:07:53
That is very few.
That is very few.
It's amazing.

JT: 0:07:54-0:07:55
It's [aiʃəlduʃəl ??? 7:54] of the legend.

AF: 0:07:55-0:08:01
Yeah, right.
Yeah.

You know, you know what I found...[RECORDING CUTS]
