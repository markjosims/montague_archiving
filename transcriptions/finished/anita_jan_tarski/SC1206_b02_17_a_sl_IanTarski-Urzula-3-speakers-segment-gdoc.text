AF: 0:00:02-0:00:18 This is just a check to see I left something pushed in and ran my good batteries down.

That's a pain in the neck.

Shame on you wasting at least a dollar.

Can't afford to do that.

Do you know anything about that story?

JT: 0:00:20-0:00:34 Not any more than what I actually read saying she wants an article that my father sort of described his wife I think animalistically anti-Semitic or something!

AF: 0:00:34-0:00:36 Yeah, yeah, but you don't know–any I'm going to put this over here.

JT: 0:00:37-0:00:49 No, no I don't maybe would be better to... Oh, oh, ah ha! Yes, that's it.

AF: Yes, that's going in. So you don't know any more details?

JT: That's what I read.

AF: 0:00:49-0:03:22 Let's see.

Things had already gone bad between Łukasiewicz and Leśniewski and Tarski as in Poland, like in the late thirties, that there was some encounter that Peter Hoffman described where they actually asked Tarski to come see him about something at a cafe, but then they would not they wouldn't they went to meet him in the hall and they didn't invite him to the table, so they weren't even sitting together, they wouldn't sit with him at the same table and there was a lot of bitterness about that. Because they had been, of course, so such close colleagues and even friends I suppose and so this was Łukasiewicz...

JT: And Leśniewski on one hand against my father on the other.

AF: Sort of both pro and con, because they were for him in terms of the work, but then in the anti Semitic climate that existed in Poland, you know approaching the 39 there was a refusal to be seen with type of atmosphere and you don't know any more about that than I'm telling you.

JT: No.

AF: Okay Hoffman is the source for these stories and Hoffman say,s I mean there's no reason not to believe them.

I don't think Hoffman would make up stories like that, do you?

JT: No I believe he should be reliable.

AF: Reliable, and that Tarski felt a real bitterness, a real sense of betrayal particularly by Łukasiewicz, because he had been... Łukasiewicz had a wife who was not exactly somebody that everybody welcomed into their home and so forth, but Tarski did.

I mean he was friendly towards her, and so this turning against him was particularly bitter. But you don't know any stories like that?

JT: No.

AF: Okay. Yeah let's see if there's any other. Do you know who was called Maria Kokoszyńska?

JT: Lutmanowa's maiden name?

Yeah and well she was a logician and interested in truth...

AF: Because I have quite a few letters in one of the boxes from her in Polish and it's a name I don't know.

So she was a logician.

JT: 0:03:23-0:04:37 Yes and I think particularly interested in truth and active in Lwów as far as I know.

I'm sure that Forenski described this wrote something about her in his book on the Lwów Warsaw school. Yes and, let's see it's possible that she was in the Wrocław afterwards for a long years I see in which case Urszula certainly know.

AF: I don't know, there are folders in there when I see that there are letters in Polish, of course I'm not reading them or I can't use them. And there are quite a few letters from Russia and then there's a folder of letters from Kołakowski again in Polish

JT: My father expressly thanked Kokoszyńska in the article of 1944 the well known one on Semantic Conception of Truth.

There are a lot of various details, material that was gathered from all kinds of remarks and he thanked her for helping put this together.

AF: 0:04:38-0:04:44 Okay so those are probably the professional letters of some sort.

JT: 0:04:44-0:05:47 Yes. In the Bancroft Library there's a folder with the letters from her. What years did you notice?

AF: I actually didn't look at the dates but it has

JT: That would be very interesting. I mean probably they were from postwar years.

AF: I would guess that in one of the later boxes...

JT: Possibly something from the time of the war but one moment let me I think I can interrupt Urszula for a moment.

Well she does remember her from, yes

AF: Okay so maybe we'll ask her when she's through

JT: I don't know that she would be through.

AF: 0:05:47-0:06:04 Oh! [LAUGHTER] I see, yeah. Now can you tell me, either Peter Hoffman or Michalsky said that [Erin Foyd's ???] family was related to the Witkiewicz family?

JT: 0:06:04-0:07:14 Witkacy? [Yeah] I heard something like this.

AF: That they were connected

JT: I'm afraid it's something I never learned.

It should not be very difficult to find out, my sister might possibly know herself being closer to the parent Foyds.

AF: Do you know whether she saw Anna when she went, Anna Tarska, when she went to Poland this time?

JT: I believe she did yes. [URSZULA ENTERS] Apparently there's a folder of letters from Kokoszyńska to my father in the bank of library.

UT: Here?

JT: In Berkeley.

UT: In Berkeley?

AF: Yes, but I didn't look at the dates of them. So what is her age about? Or is she dead?

UT: She's dead about twelve twelve years ago

AF: Do you know when she was born?

UT: 0:07:16-0:08:31 Hm when I don't know

AF: Did you know her personally?

UT: Yeah so she proposed me the work at the Wrocław University.

AF: I see she suggested that you go there and she was there herself that's where she was?

UT: She was.

AF: She lived, She worked at Wrocław

JT: 1905 1981. Born 1905 died in 1981.

AF: So very contemporary with Tarski.

JT: Yes.

UT: She was very very nice woman very very nice woman.

AF: But she was your professor?

UT: No [URSZULA AND JAN TALK IN POLISH]

JT: She was half the time in Opole which is how long many? about seventy kilometers from Wrocław

UT: Eighty.

JT: 0:08:31-0:08:41 Eighty kilometers and she and Słupecki used to go to Wrocław regularly to attend the seminars arranged by Kokoshinska.

UT: 0:08:42-0:12:53 She was a friend of Professor Słupecki, very, very close relationships, and she was a particularly nice woman. And Professor Słupecki said that she is a very nice woman and very wise. Sometimes she drive me...

JT: Crazy?

UT: She drive me a car! [LAUGHTER] Yeah she [TALKS POLISH]

JT: Something quite rare! A car's such a precious possession.

UT: This woman who's seventy years old drives a car. She drives car to finish to end her leave and she lived in Oporów.

JT: District of Wrocław

UT: Where many scientists from Lwów from Lwów when

JT: When the university in Wrocław was established.

UT: Then many people came to Wrocław

JT And yes, the university was almost moved as what remained open as a block open to Wrocław with libraries and such.

AF: I see.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: She lived in a district that was so to say taken over by the city as the city as a whole was taken from Germans, and the owners were essentially gone and the houses were distributed to a large extent to the former faculty of Lwów and a number of scientists from Lwów the lived there.

AF: So it was a scientific community.

JT: Well academic more generally yes. But scientists you mentioned

AF: Now what was the relationship between Słupecki and...

JT: Kokoszyńska

UT: Kokoszyńska...

AF: No, Tarski.

UT: I don't know, now that Professor Kokoszyńska Lutmanowa has been on the conference [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: She was really a pupil of Ajdukiewicz, Kokoszyńska.

AF: And you were a student, ypur professor, now who was your professor?

JT: 0:12:54-0:13:37 Twój profesor, Słupecki. [Your professor, Słupecki.]

UT: Tak. Jerzy Słupecki. [Yes. Jerzy Słupecki.]

AF: So Słupecki, and what were Słupecki and Tarski's relationship?

UT: Tarski and Słupecki [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: They had the same teachers.
 AF: So they had Leśniewski and Łukasiewicz and also Kotarbiński as well?

JT: She does not regard Kotarbiński as the logician, as a teacher of the logicians, of the young logicians, no. But my father evidently does regard.

AF: Your father regarded Kotarbiński extremely highly. I think he was a moral a moral influence spiritual and I think he always liked to mention him first.

JT: 0:13:37-0:14:23 Above Leśniewski even

AF: Abovethe two of them yes, and I think you might explain that to her.

JT: And she sort of likes to make the point that Słupecki felt it was that my father's outlook in this respect was insulting to Łukasiewicz.

AF: Yes so I think it was deliberately so

JT: I see! And I did not know, it's hard to say what was the relative influence, but Urszula likes to relate the opinion of Słupecki that Łukasiewicz deserves a lot more credit than my father has been given me.

AF: 0:14:23-0:14:25 Well because does she understand how angry your father became?

JT: 0:14:26-0:16:53 Yes that it was on account of matters of anti Semitism.

AF: Right

JT: I think there's more to it than that. If you look at the first papers of my father's then there are many references or occasions to mention Leśniewski and not at all Łukasiewicz. Oh no! I think there is only one mention of Łukasiewicz somewhere in the first several papers.

AF: So I think I think there was a personal and a professional separation, is my [Yes] And that the professional came first and the personal afterward.

[lestɪf kesiŋ ??? 15:05] had a lot more of ideas that my father, sort of, could weigh and appreciate and perhaps use them as the basis for his further speculations. And Leśniewski's work in logic, no sorry Łukasiewicz's work in logic amounted to sentential calculus which is really baby stuff.

Sorry? Or for Łukasiewicz it was primarily sentential calculus. And also history of logic which was something from which my father was quite removed. I mean that's perhaps the primary credit of Łukasiewicz. The discovery of the stoic school.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: Słupecki regards himself as a pupil-of whom first Łukasiewicz?

Łukasiewicz in the first place in the second place and my father in the third place. And she said that Kotarbiński was primarily in Łódź, the Polish city of Łódź. And so he really was just a little bit to the side of the.

AF: Right, well and he didn't deal with the same issues either

JT: Sorry?

AF: 0:16:54-0:17:07 He didn't deal with the same subject matter.

JT: He did not deal with the same subject and there was also the geographical separation.

AF: So did... I'm having trouble pronouncing it, Słupecki?

JT: Słupecki

AF: Słupecki. Did he actually take courses from Tarski? Did he go to-?

JT and UT: 0:17:07-0:18:41 [TALK IN POLISH]

JT: As Urszula put it the seminars were under the direction of Łukasiewicz and Leśniewski but my father had many talks, gave many talks in the seminars and in this sense Słupecki learned from my father. And my father obtained his doctorate in 1924 and Słupecki, because of health problems, only in 1935. So for many years my father already had many of his own discoveries to talk, about to present and Leśniewski was only finishing...Słupecki was only finishing the doctor.

AF: 0:18:42-0:19:04 Would you before just as I think but would you write your name and your address?

This is the only, I have this funny pad but-

UT: Mine?

AF: Your name and- 

JT: In Poland?

AF: In Poland. You have a card? Yeah that's better. Great, that's fine.

JT: 0:19:05-0:19:08 Would you like a piece of tape?

AF: 0:19:13-0:19:20 No, I'll take the card. Yeah good, thank you. Let's see what I want to do.

JT: Could I offer you something like coffee or juice or-

AF: 0:19:20-0:19:21 A little coffee would be wonderful. How's our time? So I think we're okay. Maybe another.

UT: 0:19:23-0:19:51 No exchange of the phone numbers and before three is five and here probably five four. In our area is changed the numbers, phone numbers but here I don't know because I changed my...

AF: But this is your what's the best address to write you?

UT: This is private address.

AF: 0:19:51-0:19:55 This is private address. And do you have an email?

UT: 0:19:56-0:20:28 Email yeah.

AFL: Does it work?

UT: Perfect now will be changed because Okalew is relatively little town and we have only in my department

AF: Well that's what I thought, since you're in computer science.

UT: Only one, yes. And therefore we have often the change of the email.

AF: 0:20:28-0:20:38 Why don't you just put it under here? Well if it changes you will, it'll no doubt be able to be forwarded.

UT: 0:20:38-0:20:40 This is

AF: Do you know Szczerba?

UT: Yeah. [You do know?] This is my friend.

AF: 0:20:40-0:21:00 Oh he's your friend. [Yeah] Oh! I've been, if I'd only known because I have some pictures that I wanted to send him but I didn't want to send it to him before I was sure that it would get to him. Because I'd sent him an email and I also sent him a letter and I didn't get an answer.

UT: 0:21:02-0:21:03 He has email?

AF: 0:21:04-0:21:28 I know he does, but he never answered me. Maybe I don't have it right.

UT: Yeah

AF: So I'll... because I was surprised because he doesn't seem like the person who wouldn't answer. Do you have his email as well? Or just-

UT: I see.

AF: I'll check it again, because I do have an address I have a couple of addresses for him.

UT: If this...

JT: Excuse me, Urszula? I take it you'd like some coffee also.

UT: 0:21:28-0:21:32 Also, yeah.

JT? Some juice maybe?

UT: Coffee.

JT: Coffee. No juice?

AF: 0:21:32-0:21:35 Coffee, coffee is fine.

UT: 0:21:38-0:21:45 I don't know if I have, no in this-

AF: No email in there.

UT: No email.

AF: 0:21:45-0:22:02 I've got what I'll do is maybe I'll send you an email. So this is U-W-S S-P-A-R, is this an R?

UT: 0:22:02-0:22:07 This is [pɛs ???] letter my, Urszula Wibranic Skardowska Spark because this is

AF: But that's an R. S-P-A-R, see?

UT: This is an I.

AF: 0:22:07-0:22:17 Oh an I, see S-P-A, but this one.

UT: R [yeah okay] R-C. This is "one."

AF: Yeah. Is this a dash here?

UT: 0:22:18-0:22:19 This is dash this is one.

AF: 0:22:20-0:22:26 And there's no dot until here. There's no dot here. All of this is all in one. There's not a dot after the UWS?

UT: 0:22:28-0:22:29 I don't understand.

AF: 0:22:32-0:22:38 Well usually there's some place where there's an at. Like, this is my address.

UT: 0:22:40-0:22:45 Yeah, I'm sorry, sorry.

AF: 0:22:50-0:23:03 Something doesn't look right there.

Okay all right. A spark, that's better yeah [Here] yeah right.

That's where it belongs. Your own personal... And then this and then this is a dash, not a dot. There's this line one.

UT: 0:23:04-0:23:04 This is one.

AF: 0:23:04-0:23:05 Yeah, but I need to put this in.

UT: 0:23:06-0:23:10 Yeah because in Poland "one" we write this.

AF: 0:23:11-0:23:40 I know but I'm worried about this right here.

UT: This is...

AF: Yeah and that belongs, okay. Because I haven't seen that on anybody else's okay-

UT: And before we had this cut email.

AF: Okay all right, well I'll try it and see if it goes.

At any rate if I send you email then you can check maybe for Szczerba's email from me and then I can... But also give him my regards and I'll see if I have a card.

I'll give you my card.

UT: 0:23:40-0:24:00 And I'll do Professor Pawlok, Profesor Pawlok.

He has active email. I know.

AF: 0:24:00-0:24:31 Right. But anyway give my greetings to Szczerba. Do you see him regularly?

UT: Yes, okay then-

AF: Give him my greetings. Tell him I have two beautiful pictures... What did I do? I guess I've just wrote these on here by hand for some reason. I must run out of cards.

So that's it. So give him my greetings. Tell him we have several good long conversations that I take recorded in Poland and I've wanted to be in touch with him.

UT: Thank you.

JT: 0:24:33-0:24:47 One thing-

AF: 0:24:50-0:24:53 Here is a nice picture. A nice picture, that's my grandchild.

JT: 0:24:54-0:24:57 Grandchild. Wanted to say, speaking of Kokoszyńska, this is her first note. This is the well known basic mathematic conception of truth.

AF: 0:24:58-0:25:07 Yeah okay [UNINTELLIGIBLE] Collected Papers vol. 2.

JT: 0:25:07-0:25:12 Yes, but it's, this paper especially you will find produced in many places. I'm sure that Solomon is aware of that.

AF: 0:25:12-0:25:15 Yeah.

UT: 0:25:20-0:25:23 That's very nice. How old is she?

AF: 0:25:23-0:25:30 She's, yeah, she's seven months now. That was I think she was about six months.

JT: 0:25:38-0:25:52 Oh I showed this-

AF: I saw that, that's a wonderful picture.

JT: This is a guard of...

AF: I thought maybe that was a bodyguard.

JT and UT: 0:25:53-0:25:53 [TALK POLISH]

JT: 0:25:56-0:25:59 Yes you guessed right-

AF: A bodyguard?

IT: It's a bodyguard.

AF: 0:26:00-0:26:07 Didn't he just have that look? Of a bodyguard? That's how they all look, the same!

JT: This one also? No!

AF: 0:26:09-0:26:10 On the other side.

JT: 0:26:12-0:26:13 Yes, yes.

AF: 0:26:17-0:26:27 Let's see, what else did I want? So do you have a sense of how close as friends Witkiewicz and Tarski were? Do you know?

JT: 0:26:27-0:26:35 Hard to say. But I had occasion to look at some of the philosophical texts of Witkacy.

AF: 0:26:35-0:26:36 Yeah.

JT: 0:26:36-0:26:38 And he was not particularly kind to my father.

AF: 0:26:39-0:26:54 He was not kind to but that doesn't mean they wouldn't have though he wasn't kind to anybody!

I mean I meant whether there was a genuine friendship there as a, not a professional friendship but a personal friendship. You don't know?

JT: 0:26:54-0:27:03 I think it was there was some kind of a friendship something in that direction. How close I just couldn't tell you.

AF: 0:27:03-0:27:03 Yeah. Right.

JT: 0:27:03-0:27:17 But I think they certainly knew each other and I'm sure that they had occasions to meet over coffee, cup of coffee and such, and not only in the painter and client.

AF: 0:27:17-0:27:36 Well you know Witkiewicz lived in Zakopane, which is near in the Tatar, I guess at the base of the Tatar Mountains and of course the Tarski, your parents went all the time to go hiking but I don't know whether they actually went and stayed with Witkiewicz. Did they stay in Zakopane? Would they have done that, do you think?

JT: 0:27:38-0:27:43 I think that they would be more likely to go up to the mountains rather than stay in Zakopane.

AF: 0:27:43-0:27:50 No, but I mean isn't Zakopane a place where you might start and then go climbing afterwards? Use that as your base camp as it were?

JT: 0:27:50-0:28:13 Yes, but whether they would be staying with Witkiewicz and with Witkacy, I rather doubt it. You know, Zakopane is one place where you have tourists coming all the time and who are here would sort of tend to be, tend to withdraw from and not be eager to receive so many guests because otherwise they would have to put up with the guests permanently.

AF: 0:28:13-0:29:22 Well, but they sort, there was sort of a salon there as I understand it.

JT: I have no idea no idea.

AF: One of the people who wrote the most about Witkiewicz is somebody named Gerould, Daniel Gerould, who's the editor of many of the books of plays and so forth. And he was in Berkeley and he acknowledges both your mother and father as sources for stories about Witkiewicz.

So that's what made me think that there must have been something more than just sitting for a portrait, more than just casual acquaintance.

JT: Definitely. My father said it wasn't just that he saw the name announced or advertised somewhere and went to him and paid them to pick up the picked up the portrait.

AF: But Witkiewicz also went to seminars at the, you know-

JT: Witkiewicz? Oh he also had a philosophical point of view and he wrote about philosophy.

AF: Total madman! Absolute madman. Have you seen any of his plays?

UT: This plays?

AF: Witkiewicz's plays, have you seen any performed?

UT: 0:29:24-0:29:34 I don't know I'm thinking that Witkiewicz lived in different places.

AF: 0:29:34-0:29:58 Oh yeah, he lived he lived in Zakopane, he came to Warsaw but his plays were performed all around so... And apparently there's been a renaissance of his work and so that people in theater are doing his plays. I mean they were twenty five years ahead of their time, people say. So I thought maybe you might have seen.

JT: 0:29:58-0:30:00 I don't remember do you take sugar?

AF: 0:30:00-0:31:28 No it's just fine. Thank you.

JT: Milk?

AF: No perfect unless it's so strong that it... It's good, yeah. Good coffee.

So that's something that, well I'll ask around. I've actually written to this man but he hasn't answered. But there are, I don't know, four or five or six books now, in English, about Witkiewicz.

And also there's a book... there's a book of interviews between Aleksandr Wat and Miłoś.

UT: Miłoś.

AF: Miłoś. And those are interesting reflections on life at home because Wat was an exact contemporary of Tarski, and also was a Jew who became assimilated and who converted. Who, took on the... I think, and also was for a time communist and then anti...

And so some of the patterns of his life are similar to the patterns of Tarski's life, just the social aspects, the social political aspects of his life.

So I've been reading those conversations.

UT: 0:31:30-0:32:32 I know that my teacher is Professor Lili Słupecki very appreciate the activity of Tarski and he said us that Taski was the special genius and he needn't the teachers.

AF: He didn't what?

UT: He didn't teachers. He needn't-

JT: He did not need teachers.

That's what she what Słupecki used to say about my father.

AF: To teach himself and

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: 0:32:32-0:32:44 Słupecki does the same thing. Słupecki would appear that my father went to the seminars and took advantage of the atmosphere and the various remarks, but basically he did not need a teacher.

AF: 0:32:44-0:33:02 He didn't need a teacher. Well sure by that time he was yeah...

Did he say anything about his talents of exposition? How he what kind of a teacher Tarski himself was? How did he describe Tarski's lectures to you?

What did he say about Tarski's man?

JT and UT: [TALK IN POLISH]

JT: 0:33:02-0:35:24 She will have to recall.

AF: Right, nothing specific comes to mind. Well I just wondered if he held if Słupecki held him up as he up as a model or not.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: They were extremely clear. That's what Słupecki seems to remember.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

The students in Wrocław they all heard about my father and Słupecki used to say that he can use these worlds as models where every detail has been thought through, yes.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: 0:35:24-0:38:29 He used to say Warsaw school rather than Lwów, so he never used the name of Lwów.

AF: So it was the Warsaw school.

JT: During the time when you were a student in Wrocław.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: Urszula says that Słupecki emphasized the formal and side of the teachings of the Warsaw school and that the formal aspects were emphasized all the time. And she says that she finds it hard to incorporate Kotarbinski into that outlook or this point of view, because of his opposite...

AF: Picture.

JT: Or different or, yes.

UT and JT: [TALK IN POLISH]

JT: "Well look you were" he said "talking and talking and talking and talking and then you know by the time you finished I forgot what you said in the beginning!"

UT and JT: [TALK IN POLISH]

JT: Słupecki has emphasized the importance of this of the Warsaw school yes

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: Because of the ability or the emphasis on the formal and precise solutions.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: And also, assuming certain philosophical outlook...

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: ...and precise formal solutions. I think this is, my father had quite a bit more in him that went beyond the formal.

AF: 0:38:29-0:40:16 Absolutely. I mean everybody brings in this business of him speaking of himself as a nominalist and his believing in being kind of a Platonist, somehow, deep down.

And then there are various quotes that people will say of what he himself said. He says that he "realizes it's all fairy tales but it's good to believe in fairy tales." So there is a, you know, there's a duality in people. I think that's important to remember, especially when you're...

Each piece of work is discrete, you know, but when you're talking about a scope of a life, people are conflicted. They don't always... There are always these two things that pull at you. And so I think it's not, you know each piece of work is a piece of work in itself, but what happens over a lifetime and what people's temptations are and how they may resist these temptations.

So Tarski himself spoke of these temptations, and it really is interesting that he thinks always thought of Kotarbiński as his mentor and I think it was a good deal a spiritual mentor more than, you see what I mean?

But I don't devalue it because of that, when I'm speaking of a life.

In other words, if you're speaking of each discrete piece of work, you might look at it differently. But if you're speaking of a life that includes more than work, or yeah.

JT: 0:40:17-0:41:17 The formal side is something my father could have learned by himself or by himself and the philosophical vision is something that he could not.

AF: Well you could, you could come to that.

JT: Well I mean but in his case this he got from Kotarbiński. 

AF: It was an early inspiration, let's say.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

AF: What's [kata dre]?

JT: Under the chair.

AF: Yeah.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: Leśniewski and Łukasiewiczh were both philosophy students under Twardowski. [Yes] It was really kind of a surprise, something really incredible almost that they became professors of mathematics.

AF: 0:41:18-0:42:14 Of mathematics, yes. You know I have this funny what's the word conjecture about Tarski choosing the name "Tarski".

The story is, according to Dana Scott, that he chose the name because the person-if you took another name and it belonged to somebody else that person had a right to refuse that you take that name-and so he and his brother who were both...looked through all the registry of names for Warsaw and they only found one old woman with this name "Tarski." So they figured she wasn't likely to complain, so that was a safe name to take.

But my further conjecture is that it's a contraction of Twardowski so that it was a very pleasing name for him to take I don't know if he take. No proofm no proof of cours! But it just struck me one day that Tarski and Twardowski you take out a few letters and you've got that.

So why not? And he's the kind of man who would have thought of that. If I thought of it so would he!

JT: 0:42:14-0:42:28 My mother related something like this. Perhaps not as full a story, or a slightly different version, that was taped by Constance Reed?

AF: 0:42:28-0:42:44 Yeah.

Well tell me what you 'cause when I asked Constance Reed about this tape she doesn't remember, she doesn't know where it is tell me the story

JT: I don't know where the tape is but I remember this being taped.

AF: Okay, so tell me what she told her on the tape because I may not hear it from Constance.

JT: 0:42:46-0:43:32 She essentially said the same thing except that my father... She didn't, that is my mother, did not recall this question of somebody being able to protest, but my father just did not want to have a name that would be very common. So when he came up on this name and found that just that there was [Only one] one old woman or something approximately that then he was ready to adopt it.

AF: Yeah it is a very unusual name certainly.

JT: we remember there being listed in the phone book here in the Bay Area some Tarski here we had some phone calls asking for the famous pilot.

AF: 0:43:33-0:45:16 Pilot?

JT: Yes.

AF: Oh really?

JT: Pilot!

AF: Airplane. So well that's interesting.

Well any more stories about Tarski that you know that people have told you? [Yeah] Okay, what sort of stories do you hear? Any kind!

Gossip, mathematical, social?

UT: [TALKING FAINTLY] No, mathematical and [UNINTELLIGIBLE] logic historians

UT and JT: [TALK IN POLISH]

JT: She says she can perhaps recreate some stories or details by talking with Słupecki's widow.

AF: That would be wonderful! I would really appreciate that if you would ask him. Any kind of stories! Gossip, romances.

[LAUGHTER]

You know what I like very much in a book are anecdotes, not generalizations. You know, what brings a book to life is the detail.

So you know a specific thing that happened in a seminar, a specific conversation. Specificity is what counts. Those generalizations are not any fun to read.

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: 0:45:38-0:45:54 One moment let me translate that. One difficulty with this is that Słupecki did not like to chat or to relate anecdotes. He sort of tried to restrict himself to just strict business like scientific matters.

AF: 0:45:55-0:46:27 Yeah, but even in scientific matters sometimes there is an anecdote, you see what I mean, that is an illustration of an exchange.

You know what I mean? It's always the small detail, the conversation that illuminates the whole. And no matter what kind of thing you're writing you need that. And so it doesn't have to be gossip but it has to deal with a small thing that illuminates the large. So if there's something that he can remember about-

JT: 0:46:29-0:47:00 That she would be she, Słupecki's widow now.

AF: Oh yes oh I see yes. Or she would...

UT: [TALKS IN POLISH]

JT: Słupecki wrote an article in Polish about the Lwów school. Not Lwów, but Warsaw school! Yes, and she has this at home in Poland.

AF: 0:47:01-0:47:34 Well there are any if in that article if you look through it and you see anything that is a detail and you can tell me what the circumstances are around the detail.

But I just read something by somebody that I know, actually, which was about Lydia Ginsburg, a writer and a critic in Russia. This is a Slavist who wrote this thing. And it is really an extremely intellectual article about a very specific take on literary criticism, let's say.
