HG: 0:00:00-0:46:42
He gave me the impression that he was assimilated altogether.
That he wasn't, not that he was particularly keen to hide it, but he wasn't particularly keen to display it either.
It was something that he wouldn't hide, but something that for him was completely a neutral issue.
He didn't present himself as a Jew or didn't appear to be a Jew, didn't say he was Jewish and so on.
He was completely cosmopolitan in his outlook, in his politics, and so on.
He was conservative in many respects, but kind of a mildly liberal.

AF:
In some areas.

HG:
In some areas.
I remember when we spoke, he thought, well, yeah, the Jewish claim to Israel, that's a joke.
You can't make a claim because 2 thousand years ago and so on.
But okay, so you managed somehow to do that, let's see what we can do now and so on.
I mean, legally it means nothing.
He was very cosmopolitan.

AF:
Yeah, Rabin said that he avoided the issue of talking, even when he was in Israel, he didn't talk at all, at all about that.
On the other hand, he, from other people, I've learned that he, that the few people he did talk to about being Jewish, he had some fairly, some of the typical traumatic experiences that little Jewish boys in Warsaw had.
You know, he was called a dirty Jew, he was beaten up on his way home from the park by gangs of boys, he and his brother, and so forth.
So it's not that those things weren't in his background, but he chose not to focus on them.

HG:
But the reason for changing of name was that he didn't want to appear Jewish, he was in this Polish society.
And I was, I heard that academically his career was held back, he had found it very difficult to get a reasonable position in the Polish university.
So he was always a docent.

AF:
All the while being encouraged to change his name.
It was a policy of the university to encourage people to change their name.
And he still didn't get his job.
Damned if you do and damned if you don't.

HG:
Yes.

SF:
Excuse me, where were you born?

HG:
In the Ukraine.
Now it is in Ukraine.

AF:
Oh really?
Where?


HG:
Rovno.
It's not far from Chernobyl.
Well, it's not in the area, but it's in western Ukraine.
It's near the border between...
Well, at that time it was some region that was going back and forth from Russia to Poland.

AF:
Oh really?

And when did you go to Israel then?


HG:
I came just before the Second World War.
I was two years old when I came to Israel.

AF:
When you went to Israel.
But it was before the war.

HG:
Yeah, just before.

AF:
Why did you ask?


[CROSSTALK]

AF:
I thought maybe it occurred to you that he looks a little like your father, because he does to me.

SF:
He does, yeah.

AF:
And Sol's father, especially the top of your...
Sol's father was born in Omsk, in the fringes of Siberia.
And he actually is, what, Sol's father was half Jewish.
Half or three quarters?

AF:
No, half.
His mother, but nobody, everybody, everybody always assumed he was all Jewish.
It was, it wasn't until years later that he confessed to being only part Jewish.
But, was in Siberia, that edge of Siberia.
But I thought that's why you asked, because of the similarity in their appearance.

SF:
Well, maybe.
I didn't think of it, but it's true.

AF:
The construction of your face from...
And the thing is that Sol and his father look very much alike, and yet I don't think of the two of you as looking alike.

HG:
Yeah.
It's not a transitive difference.

AF:
Yeah, right.
But it is...
Anyway, well, that's...

SF:
That's right.
Both our daughters look like me, but they don't look like each other.

AF:
Like each other.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, anyway, back to Tarski.
So just the way he looks.
Well, it's interesting.
People describe him in different ways.
Some people, the first thing they say about him is that he's small.
Other people don't think he's small at all.
It must have to do with their own stature or how they feel about him.
Some people have said they thought he looks French.

HG:
French?

AF:
Yes.
You know people.
Everybody puts their own construct on something.
So that's, I do like to ask.

SF:
So he looked European?

AF:
He certainly looked European.

HG:
Yeah, he certainly looked European.
But he could come from any place.

AF:
Yeah.
Well, when he opened his mouth, you knew he was either Polish or Russian.
There's no question, with the "[xa xa xa]" accent.

HG:
And he had some quite conservative opinions, I mean, opinions that nowadays would be called "racial."

AF:
Oh, yeah.
Right.
And he had some activities that nowadays would be called "harassment."
Yes.

HG:
Oh, yeah.
He wouldn't be able to get away with it nowadays.

AF:
No.
Yeah.
But were you aware of gossip about him?
Were people talking about him?
[Oh, yeah.]
So who did you hear about?

HG:
I heard about the story about Dorothy I had already when I came.

AF:
What did you hear?
That's actually one of the harder stories to track down.

HG:
There was this woman who was a secretary there.
And she was this kind of official, unofficial consult.

AF:
Yeah, yeah, right, okay.

HG:
And that's one thing.
And then I heard that he was kind of messing around with graduate students.
Yeah, yeah.
And that he had an affair with, there were rumors that he had an affair with Polish logicians.

AF:
Yeah, like...

HG:
Shmulev.

AF:
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

HG:
I don't know about...
What's the other...
Oh, the one called...

SF:
Roshova.

AF:
I don't know about Roshova.
Roshova was connected with Sikorsky somehow.

AF:
It didn't occur to me that we had something with Roshova.

HG:
I heard all kinds of rumors that Tarski boasted of his conquests.

AF:
But not to you.

HG:
Not to me, but I know of several affairs that he had with wives of his colleagues.

AF:
Oh yeah?
Like for example?

HG:
I don't know that I want to go into that.

AF:
Well, without...
Oh, really?
Yeah.

HG:
I don't want to go into that.
I know two cases.

AF:
In Berkeley?

HG:
Not in Berkeley.

AF:
In Poland?

HG:
No, in the USA.

AF:
In the USA.

HG:
People who kind of were very collegiate, very friendly terms, and really looked up to him and estimated it all, and he took the occasion and had the...

AF:
Affairs with their wives.

HG:
Yes, he had a flame with their wives.

AF:
Now that I haven't heard.
That's new to me.
But of course, every gossip you can't trust.

HG:
One of it I know.

AF:
You know?

HG:
I know.
Because the person...
Because the woman itself hinted as much.
It was very clear.
And the other I heard reported that he boasted of it.

AF:
Huh.
That's amazing.
That's news.
I mean, a lot of his affairs were extremely open.
For example, the Shmuleff affair.
The whole family knew about it.
I mean, the Tarski family knew about it, including the kids.
I mean, that, although a lot of people didn't know about it at the time, subsequently, I've learned that a lot of people knew about it and it was open knowledge in the household.
So that's as brazen an event as any.
Then I know now pretty much for a fact about several students and other people.
But I haven't heard about wives of colleagues, you know, who are currently in that, and I've also heard about the boasting, and I've heard...

HG:
He was discreet there, but I heard about the boasting that he had an affair with that and that wife.

AF:
Yeah, he did, yeah.

HG:
That I heard reported that he boasted in some party or something.
The other, I just happen to know.

AF:
You just know.

HG:
I just know because...

SF:
We could make a guess.
But no, he's saying it's not a local person, not a person in Berkeley.

HG:
No.

AF:
No.

HG:
No.

AF:
No.
Well, I don't think...
Is the person still alive?

HG:
No.

AF:
No.

HG:
Still, I don't...

AF:
You don't want to do it?

HG:
I wouldn't do it.

AF:
You don't want to...

HG:
Because the woman herself said she didn't feel good about it.
She said she made a mistake.

AF:
Yeah, well, he was...
I mean, from somebody who I've gotten...
I mean, I don't know if I'm going to use her name or not, so I won't use it now, but somebody that I've gotten a very detailed account of what their relationship was like, he put such pressure on her that finally it was as if she said, "oh, what the hell, what's the big deal?"
And then she was sorry, but because it happened, once you say yes, then of course it repeated itself.
So it was hard to, you know, and that was it.

HG:
He was completely, very much obsessed.
If he would like a woman, it became like, I don't know, like some kind of trait of character.

AF:
Yeah, he had–

HG:
He doesn't release.

AF:
Yeah, same thing as having priority.

HG:
Yes, having priority in that.
He got into kind of obsessive about that.

AF:
Right, right.

HG:
Until he got his wish.

AF:
Yeah, and I seem to think he was attractive.
And I mean, the woman that you know, did she feel attracted to him in any way?
In a physical way?

HG:
I don't know.
I wouldn't...
I don't know why.
Somehow he seemed very forceful and some kind of...
this kind of thing.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I thought that she said explicitly that it was...
Okay, she made a mistake.
She shouldn't have done that.

AF:
Yeah.
Right.

HG:
She just...

AF:
But I mean, the question is whether she, whether it was just okay...

HG:
No, in that case, I don't think it...
I don't think that she felt that she had no choice, or better do it and so on.

AF:
Yeah, she actually wanted to at that point.

HG:
I think she was at some point, he kind of seduced her into it, or that kind of thing.
I don't think that it was a case of somebody that wanted to get rid of him.

AF:
I think some people did find him attractive, I guess.
I asked one of the secretaries that I interviewed just recently, whether he ever made advances to her, because she was attractive.
She said no.
And then I said, if he had, how would she have responded?
Did she find him attractive?
She said no.
She said, but if I had been in his field, and I had known his work, in other words, if she'd been on the same intellectual wavelength, she could see that she might have.
In other words, falling in love love with somebody's head because you know what's going on in there.
So that's, I think, a good explanation for why somebody would be seduced.

HG:
Yes, in that case, I mean, I suppose these women, they were not in the field, but they knew of his reputation because he was a colleague of their husband's and he was so much appreciated and so on.
So they were kind of overwhelmed to some extent.

AF:
He was a satyr.
I mean, I had no idea!
I mean, that's interesting.
I mean, you knew, but I had no idea the extent of his desires and needs.
He was in London for a period of time and by himself, and just kept asking the guy who he saw the most of, let's go find some women.
He needed, he physically needed women a lot.

HG: 0:13:22-0:13:31
Yes.

SF: 0:13:31-0:13:31
What were your social relations with him?

HG: 0:13:34-0:13:58
Very correct and very, he invited me to occasions here and there and so on and there was one time when he gave me a hint that he kind of he thought I should have been more accommodating to I mean kind of more fawning on him and so on
and that was when I finished the PhD then I was hesitating should I there was a possibility of getting a place in Berkeley temporary postdoc in Berkeley some kind of some kind of an appointment but at that time I was tHenking about going back to I just kind of kept hesitating and eventually I came to New York for a year, not to, actually to Colombia. But then I regretted it at some point and then I came to Tarski and asked him if he thought that it would be still possible to get the appointment in Berkeley.

AF: 0:14:42-0:14:44
Now this was a full time appointment.

HG: 0:14:44-0:14:45
This was a full time appointment but for I don't know for a year or something like that

AF: 0:14:48-0:14:49
Tried it out

HG: 0:14:49-0:14:57
Tried. I mean and then I asked him I said "look I know I mean I didn't ask it at the time but would it be still possible to get it here?"
And he said no "I mean we gave it to so and so" and he said "yes and he is more..." he gave me to understand that he was also nicer

AF: 0:15:07-0:15:07
More accommodating

HG: 0:15:08-0:15:09
More accommodating guy

AF: 0:15:10-0:15:10
More willing to do

HG: 0:15:11-0:15:27
Yes, more willing to do for that and I also think that the kind of I had to press him kind of quite hard to get a good recommendation for that. He gave a good recommendation but I remember that he was kind of he wasn't very forthcoming with it.

AF: 0:15:28-0:15:29
A good recommendation for?

HG: 0:15:30-0:15:56
A job

AF:
For a job anywhere?

HG:
Anywhere I mean he gave he said I wanted it to be, I mean he kind of duplicated it in a kind of a step in a kind of a mimeograph shape or something like tha. And then I asked the secretary well I mean can't he have it some kind of a little bit more personal in it rather than a mimeograph shape and he said "No I mean his name on it and it's worth more than that" but then I went and asked him "look can you do it?" and then he did it.

Kind of he grumbled "okay" so he did it so perhaps it was my perspective but that's the impression I got.

AF: 0:16:10-0:16:13
Where did you go? Where were you then?

HG: 0:16:15-0:16:16
I went then to Israel.

AF:
You went back to Israel.

AH:
I spent the year here

AF: 0:16:17-0:16:17
in Colombia

HG: 0:16:18-0:16:22
At Colombia and then I went back to Israel.

SF:
Did you ever visit Berkeley?

HG: 0:16:23-0:16:25
Oh yes I visited several times.
I had the same temporary appointments, half a year or for a summer. Yeah I visited. And we always met and it was very nice and cordial and so on. Yeah. I mean whenever they did invited me I think when they there was this seventy year conference I was there there was no we were always very very friendly in this respect.

AF: 0:16:58-0:16:58
Yeah. Well I mean that there are a few people who gave Tarski to understand that they weren't to be dallied with, let's say you know. They did their stuff and partly by their demeanor, I mean, and partly by just frankly saying, you know, behaving, but it's rare. And Tarski didn't like those people less, in fact, you know, he probably liked them probably respected I think

HG: 0:17:35-0:17:37
so I got this impression of it.

AF: 0:17:37-0:19:05
Right, you were respected but very few people had the guts to stand up to that and especially people who, say, went with him all the way. Who felt it was such an honor to be in his company and so forth. So I think I think this is particularly interesting to get this other view of people who didn't buy into the "European professor." His attitude was like the European professor who would let you, you could stay his assistant all your life as far as he was concerned but his priorities came first. I don't know if you know Steve Givant who was Bob Vaught's student but was supposed to be working on his own PhD. And I mean there just wasn't time to do his own work because he was so involved with doing Tarski's work that he just kept putting off his own.

SF:
He used him mercilessly

AF:
He just used it mercilessly! And Givant felt duty bound. By this time Tarski was getting old and Tarski needed him. You know and Tarski would build this thing of need. I mean it was really it was really using somebody and that's in the European way, you know. "I'm the professor you're here to serve my serve my needs" not the American way it's like "I'm the professor I'm here to help you finish as quickly as possible so that you have your wings and you fly." So it was some more...

Well how much effect did he have on you, do you think Tarski in the end in terms of...?

HG: 0:19:12-0:19:50
Mathematically quite a lot quite a lot. I mean after all the thing the whole thing in model theory then I went into Peano's arithmetic. I mean certainly the two years in Berkeley there and the seminars in the atmosphere really determined to a large extent the kind of thing I will be doing later. Un mathematics in model theory everything has to do with model theory and measurable cardinals and set theory and this kind of thing quite a lot. Quite a lot. There were other interests that he didn't that was different than, there were philosophical interest which surface now but working but put it that way work in set theory and in model theory and models of arithmetic, this whole area which really started in a way in these two years in Berkeley [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

AF: 0:20:25-0:20:27
Yeah that was part of the whole environment.

HG: 0:20:28-0:20:36
This is a kind of an impetus that you get from us, you get into the subject. It was a kind of an initiation into the subject


AF: 0:20:37-0:20:40
And it wasn't just Tarski it was everybody else

HG: 0:20:40-0:20:58
It was everybody, it was the whole thing that was building. He himself I really don't. I think the thing with measurable cardinals, for instance, started with some actually Scott made the first stab at that and this was done when I was there in Berkeley and he presented it and then I went
on
and so it's
the
whole atmosphere It's everyone that was there it was
much
personally but everyone that was there.

AF: 0:21:06-0:21:12
It was the environment that he created

HG: 0:21:13-0:21:15
This was a big, a very big achievement

AF: 0:21:16-0:21:18
So you see that as his big achievement.

HG: 0:21:19-0:21:32
Oh yeah. I think it's different, I mean it's a kind of supplying basic definitions and basic project, basic avenues of development
pointing out, mapping where it would be fruitful, the way to look at the subject, and then putting a lot of people to work on it and establishing the center in Berkeley. These are together his achievements.

AF: 0:21:51-0:23:14
One of the things, he came from this environment in Poland that was a microcosm of what he recreated in Berkeley and I think that I mean it did sort of struck us along the way that that's what he had done. There was this great fertile group in Poland that he must have had in mind that "this is the way to go." And this is what he, and he had the enormous energy to do all this stuff! I mean he really put he just put people to work and delegated responsibility and had these ideas and saw to it that they were done. I mean he didn't like doing those things himself but he was very good at seeing to it that everyone else did it. And...

HG:
I don't know how he!

AF:
Every little bit of, you know, he would stay up all night long, he'd smoke his cigarettes, he'd go to bed in the wee hours of the morning and sleep till midday and then just get going again. And then on weekends, you know he wasn't a workaholic, all the time on weekends he'd take these trips, he'd just go all over the place. He wasn't working all the time. So just this drive! I mean that's what's come through to me in talking to people, looking at just the volumes of stuff that he did. Tremendous drive, this little guy. Just a little engine!

HG: 0:23:15-0:23:22
Yeah I don't know how he got this kind of center started there I don't know I mean this was a...

AF: 0:23:23-0:23:45
Well how did he? He just decided he was going to do it. In other words he had a model for it what had been happening in Poland. I mean they had these seminars going, lots of logicians there, then he was going to Vienna back and forth so it was a very, very fertile atmosphere, that interwar period in Poland. It was just...

SF: 0:23:46-0:23:49
The first person he brought to Berkeley was Henkin

AF: 0:23:50-0:23:52
No but this started actually before Henkin came

SF: 0:23:53-0:23:54
Well he had the students before

AF: 0:23:54-0:23:55
Yeah he had the students

SF: 0:23:55-0:24:00
But actually make the appointments Henkin was the first

AF: 0:24:01-0:24:01
He got

SF: 0:24:02-0:24:06
He got the idea that there should be ten appointments in logic in the department

AF: 0:24:06-0:24:12
No ten percent of the department should be logic he decided, yeah, right. And he did it at a certain point he achieved that
We spoke to Kelly and Kelly was there early on in the forties six or something like that. Kelly was already there and he was already going he was getting Kelly to teach Set Theory, and he was already indoctrinating Kelly. Kelly didn't come there, so you know. He was getting Kelly to teach things he didn't know about. Kelly was having to learn them and was eager to learn them. And then what Bjarni Jónsson was his first student. Came there actually during the war

SF: 0:24:44-0:24:44
To Berkeley

AF: 0:24:45-0:24:54
To Berkeley, came from Iceland, and he just got going. I mean he was a determined person. And then it just built.

HG: 0:24:55-0:24:57
Were there many slots in Berkeley that you could

SF: 0:24:59-0:24:59
I don't know how he...

AF: 0:24:59-0:25:31
He created the slots, he created it! When he decided he wanted something, he just did it. Mates tells about how he would talk to him, Mates in philosophy Mates was there early, he would tell Mates to go talk to somebody who was in charge, some kind of a dean in philosophy, because he was getting appointments in philosophy as well. And he gave Mates his thesis problem as well, which was some problem in Greek philosophy, that he gave him this problem.

HG:
I didn't know that.

AF:
Yeah and he would tell Mates

HG: 0:25:31-0:25:34
He supervised the thesis in philosophy or?

AF: 0:25:36-0:25:45
No he didn't, he wasn't actually his *supervisor* but he gave him his problem. and he was on his thesis committee. So he would tell Mates to go

HG: 0:25:45-0:25:48
But the problem had, excuse me, he had something to do with logic or?

AF: 0:25:48-0:25:48
I think somethingi in Greek philosophy/

SF: 0:25:50-0:25:52
Mates wrote about stoic logic

HG: 0:25:53-0:25:54
I see I see

AF: 0:25:55-0:26:25
Mates would have to go talk to some dean who was something about creating a position, and Mates would say "I can't go talk to him." And the next day Tarski would say "Did you talk to that guy yet?" And he just kept after him and after, he just simply never took no for an answer. And finally Mates would go talk to the guy and the guy would say "I can't do that." And eventually the guy did it! You know, it was just sheer persistence again and again.

HG: 0:26:27-0:26:29
The same trait of character. [Huh?] The same character trait.

AF: 0:26:29-0:26:57
Incredible just like overwhelming a woman, overwhelming a department! I mean it was, it's clear. He hired somebody from England, invited them to come in the sixties and the guy says "You mean you could just invite me like this?" And he says "well you come for a visit" and he says "yeah but what about you know if I give up my position here?" He says "If I tell them to take you, they will take you."
And that's what he thought. And that's not only what he thought that's what happened, up to a certain point I guess. it was easier in the early days

SF: 0:27:09-0:27:10
Well but also, I mean he had supporters in the department, like Kelly and Morris, but also there were people who, maybe Maury, but there were people who were opposed to him. So I'm sure it was a struggle, it wasn't automatic if he said to bring somebody in mathematics.

AF: 0:27:31-0:27:48
Well this guy he brought in philosophy, he brought people in philosophy, and this guy came in philosophy, and this is Hans Sluga. [Yeah] He came straight because that's his story! That's it, he was at the University of London and Tarski was visiting there and... Basically he was bringing good people, he wasn't trying to cram anybody weak down anybody's throat and then you know Sluga eventually drifted away from logic and that was a great disappointment to Tarski, that he wasn't doing Tarski's kind of logic, but never mind. And that was it! He felt everybody owed him loyalty and once he so but I think that's one of the fascinating things about him is how determined he was. And it's how things get done.
If you want something you just push for it endlessly endlessly. And that's why most people get tired! They want to do something else. They want to work on their work, they don't see that as a goal. He also, he really also wanted to be a historic figure. He wanted, it seems to be pretty clear. Pretty clear, he's very happy having somebody writing a biography about him. I mean he left a lot of stuff for our biographer to found, and to someone he said who, he was very angry with, "If you don't do so such and such I'm going to lead you out of my biography." Which of course assures that that person is in!

HG: 0:29:27-0:29:31
Did he know that you were planning a biography? This was called after he died?

SF:
Way after he died.

AF: 0:29:32-0:29:38
No he didn't know I mean, he couldn't I wasn't writing biography at that time.

HG: 0:29:38-0:29:40
I see but you might have had an idea or something.

AF: 0:29:40-0:29:53
No, he had no. I think he just knew that someone. He just, I think he didn't even know he just felt, hoped I think that someone would someone would do it. I think he clearly saw himself as having a place in history. And I guess I mean I think he deserves a place in history.

HG: 0:30:00-0:30:04
I mean if he wants it so much usually people who want it so much manage to do it so much.

AF: 0:30:07-0:30:14
Well some of his personal history is interesting too, just how he got from one place to another.

HG: 0:30:15-0:30:17
I mean this wasn't his first job in the USA was it?

AF: 0:30:18-0:31:28
No, no, I mean his whole situation in the USA was interesting because he came by chance in thirty nine to give a talk and was caught. He was caught here, the Germans invaded just as he came. He was giving a talk and [looking for it, ???, 30:33] and so he, and there were lots of other people in that situation in 1939. So he gave lectures at Harvard, he lectured at the Y in New York. People patched together stuff for him. He taught at CCNY for a half year, he was at the Institute for a half year and then this job in Berkeley came in 1942 and it was only a year appointment, and he was very lucky to get it and it's because people like Quine did a lot of work in getting the job. And I think Russell made it. Well Russell, he got Russell's job at CCNY because Russell couldn't get it because of moral turpitude. That was a temporary job. And so he came in 42 and didn't in 42 he was 41 years old and he came as a temporary instructor or lecturer didn't become a professor until 1946. [STOPPEDHERE]

AF: 0:31:29-0:31:32
forty five years old before he had that job for sure.

default: 0:31:35-0:31:35
Well

AF: 0:31:35-0:31:41
maybe forty five was an associate professor in dentistry. So no that wasn't his first job

default: 0:31:41-0:31:42
but

AF: 0:31:42-0:32:00
he was already someone of great importance you know everybody he was aside from out here he was certainly known in Europe and known on the East Coast. Did you like him by the way? No you like him? I liked him got well with him. Yeah, you got long

HG: 0:32:01-0:32:05
I had no idea people were bitter about him very bitter

AF: 0:32:05-0:32:07
Who was bitter you think? I think I had

HG: 0:32:07-0:32:08
been I was kind of

AF: 0:32:09-0:32:12
dragged this even there was

HG: 0:32:12-0:32:17
a resentment there was a resentment. I didn't I liked him I got very well with

default: 0:32:17-0:32:17
him.

AF: 0:32:17-0:32:23
Well Dana ended up liking him at the end at the end but that worked out alright

HG: 0:32:24-0:32:28
that worked out but I gathered that there were resentments.

AF: 0:32:29-0:32:33
Well there were people who got cast aside. They certainly resented. Yes.

default: 0:32:34-0:32:34
And

AF: 0:32:35-0:32:41
I like No, I liked it. He liked it. Did you feel like you were a friend or more like a colleague?

HG: 0:32:43-0:33:03
It's more like I mean he wasn't kind of friendly I think the most personal thing he said to me was this is the joy when he came back with my when Maria agreed that they are together now. Yeah

AF: 0:33:04-0:33:04
so that was

HG: 0:33:05-0:33:09
this was really a kind of a personal statement. He didn't make a personal statement.

AF: 0:33:09-0:33:10
Yeah so that's

HG: 0:33:10-0:33:11
so he wasn't a friend

AF: 0:33:12-0:33:16
Did he ever talk about his kids for example his son? I remember

default: 0:33:16-0:33:20
that Yeah

HG: 0:33:21-0:33:30
kind of he wasn't I mean his son didn't make it all together related to physics here No,

AF: 0:33:34-0:33:50
I think that was a disappointment to him and it was a disappointment of his own creation. I mean he made that poor kid's life so miserable that it's no wonder but I just wondered if he spoke about don't give up

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:52-0:33:52
Yeah

AF: 0:33:55-0:33:59
Did he talk about his garden? Did he talk mostly he talked business in other words? Mostly he talks

HG: 0:34:01-0:34:02
business or talk politics

AF: 0:34:02-0:34:02
or

HG: 0:34:03-0:34:10
talk philosophy general scientific general observations this kind of thing.

AF: 0:34:10-0:34:13
Talk about art to you? Art Art, yeah

default: 0:34:14-0:34:14
No

AF: 0:34:19-0:34:21
But politics yes. Politics

HG: 0:34:21-0:34:21
yes

AF: 0:34:22-0:34:24
world politics or more local We

HG: 0:34:24-0:34:32
talked about Israeli politics, Americans,

AF: 0:34:33-0:34:33
very,

HG: 0:34:33-0:34:37
very kind of opinion about race,

AF: 0:34:38-0:34:38
about

HG: 0:34:39-0:34:39
black people

AF: 0:34:40-0:34:43
So he thought blacks were inherently inferior

HG: 0:34:43-0:35:04
He thoughts he thought all that you look at them and you see something like that and he said that there was he said that there was a big mistake made as a reaction to the Nazis that the whole concept of race became tarnished to such an extent with no serious research

AF: 0:35:04-0:35:05
You couldn't talk about it.

HG: 0:35:06-0:35:10
You couldn't talk about it and this was a shame and it should be corrected.

AF: 0:35:11-0:35:18
Yeah, I think he had a certain sympathy for this guy Shockway

HG: 0:35:18-0:35:20
Shockway I don't know

AF: 0:35:21-0:35:21
Yeah

HG: 0:35:22-0:35:23
he has one in his Jensen

AF: 0:35:24-0:35:24
I

HG: 0:35:24-0:35:25
don't know about

AF: 0:35:26-0:35:26
Jensen in

HG: 0:35:26-0:35:28
Belgium Jensen

AF: 0:35:29-0:35:30
Yeah So

HG: 0:35:30-0:35:32
might be there but I don't know

default: 0:35:35-0:35:35
I

HG: 0:35:35-0:35:48
don't I don't know about Chocolate but So he talked about that might have talked about I mean I think he was quite the cultured man he was quite well

AF: 0:35:49-0:35:53
I think he knew a lot about poetry. Yes I mean not only he knew a lot he read a lot of poetry

HG: 0:35:54-0:36:07
he knew certainly Polish I think he might have been cited Polish classics he knew I mean this kind of European education so Exactly something gave him a good amount of culture.

AF: 0:36:07-0:36:27
Well he had been involved with this Avant Garden group in Poland as they say the interwar period there was great flowering and there was a lot of the Twistek you know that name Tristek who was a logician as well who got one of the jobs that Tarski didn't get but was ten years older. He was

default: 0:36:28-0:36:28
I

AF: 0:36:28-0:38:27
guess he was I had the name I don't know at any rate Tristek was kind of tech theory Yeah But he was also a poet and maybe a painter as well and there's did you ever see this picture in Tarski's house by Litkozi Litkich Litkozi that chalk that pastel painter's portrait? I think it was one of Tarski and Maria. Now he's very famous and he was he was also a poet and a painter and there was a very large vanguard I mean large for Poland a vanguard movement in Poland in that time and he was part of that circle, part of that bohemian circle and I think this is where a lot of his sexual freedom attitudes come from that group There was a very bohemian group, a very literary theater music they would go to their special cafes and so forth. So that was part of the stuff that he sort of absorbed in his very early life and that was always I think very important to him to be part of the movers and shakers of the cultural world and he hung on to that. He used to seek out artists here and like to feel that he wasn't narrow he wasn't a provincial person he didn't do only and he had a lot of interest in botany and plants originally he didn't know that the skills Yeah he was well he had thought about being a botanist at one time so he was interested in that and a great he was also a great climber he was a great mountain walker and climber and he has there's a booklet of all the trips he took and all the passes that he crossed in the Tatra Mountains Literally every single one every walk he took very systematic Summer after

HG: 0:38:27-0:38:27
summer

AF: 0:38:28-0:38:30
Summer or not only just summers kept records of this.

HG: 0:38:30-0:38:31
He kept records

AF: 0:38:32-0:38:37
he has a record of every time he went to Zacopane or where he went and what walk he took and so forth.

HG: 0:38:37-0:38:38
Really?

AF: 0:38:38-0:38:42
Yeah so very systematic about maintaining that record

HG: 0:38:43-0:38:45
Bernold kept records of his temperature

AF: 0:38:47-0:38:48
Did he really? Yeah

default: 0:38:50-0:38:51
But

AF: 0:38:51-0:38:53
this is a fascinating little book

default: 0:38:54-0:38:54
because

AF: 0:38:54-0:39:23
it's his own Yeah I think I prefer the record of where I went to anywhere that's fascinating and who went with him who went with him and by what means of transportation just like a little code A Polish colleague came to me to the library and looked all he was able to decipher all this exactly where what the day, where it was, by what means of transportation and who was there

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:24-0:39:24
and

AF: 0:39:24-0:40:56
which And he kept that until even after he came to this country I think that goes till nineteen forty six so there are trips that he went to Long Island or he went to Maine to Point and with Lee Craney and with Hanford and I don't know whether he stopped keeping that record or the record afterwards of what he did was lost because Maria and his wife came his wife and children were left behind when he was here then they were able to come very almost immediately after the war they were able to come through many strings being pulled and after that there are no records and I don't know whether that's lost or whether he stopped keeping them but that was fascinating to find that I wish I could find out more about his early history that's the hard that's really the hardest stuff to come by. There are few people who are around living sources which are of course the best and the other sources are all conflagrated in the fires in Warsaw but there was there's a living ex sisterinlaw who had been not only to his house but to his parents' house so I have some view of that.

HG: 0:40:56-0:40:58
Did you contact his children?

AF: 0:40:58-0:40:59
Yeah, I've spoken quite a bit to

default: 0:40:59-0:41:04
them more

AF: 0:41:04-0:41:07
questions I have yeah go keep shoot

HG: 0:41:09-0:41:20
Tarski was one of the founders of the Logic methodology philosophy of science conversation maybe he was the main pusher I'm not sure

AF: 0:41:20-0:41:20
but he

HG: 0:41:20-0:41:27
had this idea of the importance of methodology of science and logic's role in that. What do you think of

default: 0:41:27-0:41:27
that?

HG: 0:41:30-0:42:09
I don't know what the I think the physicalistic dream of physicalism is so I mean but I don't think much I mean it has a historic importance I don't think nowadays something like that would be better I think no and in that respect I don't know I can't measure it's difficult to measure his own input into that because I mean this is the Vienna Circle

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:10-0:42:10
This

HG: 0:42:10-0:42:12
is the heritage of the Vienna Circle

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:12-0:42:13
The

HG: 0:42:13-0:42:16
Internet of Science Movement and

default: 0:42:18-0:42:18
so

HG: 0:42:18-0:43:05
I certainly he was influenced and he was he has some input there but I don't think his input is directly there I mean actually there are few papers that philosophers as philosophers would read few of Talki's papers Well there is the concept of truth, the logical consequence things some well journal about physics but that's about it and this was more and this view of science was shared it was a widely held view So I think he was more kind of the product of it than the initiative I see it was

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:05-0:43:05
in

HG: 0:43:05-0:43:16
that atmosphere But that particular organization or those meetings logic methodology Oh yeah that's the he was one of the initiators

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:16-0:43:16
Oh

HG: 0:43:16-0:43:20
yeah that's no question that's to his credit

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:21-0:43:24
And what do you think of those meetings? Do you think they work?

HG: 0:43:28-0:43:48
I think they kind of stop kind of deteriorate somehow but that is very difficult because this is my own point of view one becomes older and one gets kind of you know things changing here and there I mean my impression was that there was more exciting things happening at the beginning

AF: 0:43:48-0:43:49
I mean

HG: 0:43:49-0:44:03
if you remember the first meetings there were actually new results, new very exciting results declared in the I mean this result about the first Stanford in nineteen sixty yes this thing about

AF: 0:44:04-0:44:05
were you there at that time? Yes

HG: 0:44:07-0:44:19
so at the beginning you actually had things happening very live things happening nowadays it's somehow more as a kind of summing up you want to know what has been done during the year Was

AF: 0:44:19-0:44:21
that the very first name the step?

HG: 0:44:21-0:44:22
Yes I was

AF: 0:44:22-0:44:22
there

HG: 0:44:23-0:44:30
so my impression is that it's not as lively and not as forceful as it used to be

AF: 0:44:30-0:44:31
Did you go to Florence this

default: 0:44:31-0:44:32
year?

HG: 0:44:32-0:44:40
No What's the last one of these that you went to? Do you remember? I was actually the one eighty

default: 0:44:40-0:44:40
two

HG: 0:44:41-0:44:53
You didn't go to Moscow No wait a minute Moscow eighty seven? No And what was it where was it in ' eighty two? It was in Salzburg Salzburg

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:53-0:44:53
Yes

HG: 0:44:55-0:45:08
So the last one was ' eighty two that I went there let's see was what was I didn't I didn't go to Florence I was actually on the committee for probability I mean all these things but I really didn't

default: 0:45:09-0:45:09
Well

AF: 0:45:09-0:45:23
Salzburg was an exciting meeting wasn't it? Everybody was all jazzed up about arrivals and that's a side issue a side show side showing

default: 0:45:23-0:45:24
But

AF: 0:45:24-0:45:28
then if it was eighty two in Salzburg it must have been eighty six in Moscow.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:28-0:45:29
Maybe it was eighty six

AF: 0:45:29-0:45:32
Yeah Interesting yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:36-0:45:37
makes sense because

AF: 0:45:37-0:45:40
they were every four years and then well then we're

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:41-0:45:41
ninety

AF: 0:45:42-0:45:47
ninety ninety and then Florence ninety four No ninety five No

HG: 0:45:48-0:45:49
we have to check

AF: 0:45:50-0:45:50
and

HG: 0:45:50-0:45:52
maybe every three years Oh okay so

AF: 0:45:54-0:45:56
what's the last one you went to? The Moscow

HG: 0:45:57-0:45:59
Moscow yeah I think that was eighty seven

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:00-0:46:00
okay

HG: 0:46:00-0:46:09
but when I say do they do you think they work by that I mean having people from so many different fields

AF: 0:46:10-0:46:10
I

HG: 0:46:10-0:46:10
think that's a good

default: 0:46:10-0:46:11
idea

HG: 0:46:12-0:46:13
I think that's a good idea You

AF: 0:46:13-0:46:13
think the

HG: 0:46:13-0:46:15
interdisciplinary well

default: 0:46:16-0:46:16
some

HG: 0:46:16-0:46:41
of the groups don't how they interact Some of the groups how they interact but I think if it can as long as it can survive I think it's a good idea I think it's a good idea to have people from from many fields. You see the point is
