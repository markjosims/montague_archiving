SPEAKER_00: 0:00:01-0:00:18
with my father's mind yes, and this was the reason why Urshula wanted very much to come to Berkeley in June for the Congress.

She came for the Congress on the Semiotics in Berkeley.

And then was able to stay until now.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:19-0:00:28
Yeah, well I think that's true that many Poles who have come to Berkeley have come because castrophe was there.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:28-0:00:51
And many would keep Would like to still like to keep coming to the place because of the renowned was like it's sort of like coming to a holy place.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:54-0:00:55
Do you like that?

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:55-0:01:13
You make a pilgrimage.

It's like a pilgrimage.

It's a pilgrimage, huh?

Yeah.

Sort of going to the going to the source.

Wow, that's very interesting that's very important actually.

So yeah, it feels that way.

Yeah, exactly.

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:14-0:01:42
Now I think because it's so good reason or what stimulated her the most to come to Berkeley was just this magic of my father's baby.

SPEAKER_02: 0:01:42-0:01:52
Okay, no, I absolutely believe that.

Yeah.

So there's no question in your mind, Tarski lives in Poland.

Is that right?

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:53-0:02:22
He lives in our memory, yes?

Yeah.

And not only, I mean everybody wants to have to be to have some papers, tasky papers and know more about me.

About life?

About life, about life, tasky life.

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:22-0:02:24
They want to know about it.

Yes, well.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:24-0:02:25
So I have a good market.

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:28-0:02:29
Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:30-0:02:32
So I'm sure those more than myself.

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:34-0:02:45
Well, by now, you know, not very likely.

I have ambition to overcome I wrote a biography of Jean Van Hyenort.

I told you about that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:45-0:02:45
Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:46-0:03:40
Right.

And at a certain and he was alive when I started writing it, so I was interviewing him.

In other words, I didn't know when I started that I was writing a biography.

I thought I was writing something short.

And so but I interviewed him and I interviewed him and then he had this very tragic death.

And then by that time I had a lot, but somewhere in the course of the interview, I interviewed him for three years, but then I interviewed other people that knew him and I started doing other research.

And at some point he started to say to me, you know, you know more about me than I know about myself.

And in a certain way it was true because other people would tell me things about him, somebody else would say something about him with a different perspective.

He didn't remember any or else he didn't think that's the way he was, but they did.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:42-0:03:50
Matt, I would like to say one thing of a different kind of knowing that we are all short of time.

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:50-0:03:50
Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:53-0:06:10
When my father died, yes.

It was kind of a universal mourning among the Polish logicians.

They took this looked upon this as some kind of an undescribable loss.

Yes, it was really the beginning still the first two years of this state of war and somehow people felt their logic, especially that the link that they had to that one important link that they had to United States somehow had been cut had been cut.

Well, as you were saying, yes, that people started asking themselves what will it be now with our logic after the Without With that's really interesting.

They who those logicians whose work related directly to my father's work really felt this in a very personal way.

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:10-0:06:19
Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Well that's that is interesting.

I'm glad that you added that.

Yeah, no.

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:24-0:06:54
Yes, there was great eagerness to write something.

So those who had some connections with the publisher and with the publishing business or with learners started looking around to see who's really worthy of writing a article.

Right.

SPEAKER_02: 0:06:55-0:07:00
Yeah, right.

Well did they find?

Well, I guess Walansky's written a lot not directly.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:00-0:07:19
Yeah.

Let me say that I wrote an article about my father for the tenth anniversary of his death.

It was requested, in fact, by Polish language daily in New York City and finally we could not find anything of mine and I could not find a publisher.

SPEAKER_02: 0:07:19-0:07:20
Yeah.

Right.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:20-0:07:34
And it went to be a domesty but it sort of got stuck there and I'm trying to find out I'm trying to withdraw it.

I don't get any answer on it.

That's it.

That's the way with publishers registered letters saying that I mean I don't agree to any further publications.

SPEAKER_02: 0:07:34-0:07:38
Right, yeah.

Yeah, that's maddening.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:39-0:07:48
Yeah, in the in the next few months you can well expect and the first edition is planned for five hundred copies.

SPEAKER_02: 0:07:49-0:07:53
That's awfully few.

That is very few.

That is very few.

It's amazing.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:54-0:07:55
It's actually legend.

SPEAKER_02: 0:07:55-0:08:01
Yeah, right.

Yeah.

You know, you know what I found is you know what I found.
