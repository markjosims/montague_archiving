SPEAKER_01: 0:00:00-0:00:05
 Mary  told  me  that  tomorrow  should  be...  You'll  enjoy  them.  They're  all  old  guys  like  me.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:05-0:00:12
 You  guys,  okay,  what's  your  secret?  What's  your  secret?  How  would  you,  you  know,  manage?

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:13-0:00:16
 Just  a  lot  of,  just  good  clean  living.  Not

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:16-0:00:17
 really.  it

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:17-0:03:37
 Is

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:17-0:00:20
 also  a  family  thing?  I  mean,  you  know,  sometimes  it's  in  the  genes.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:20-0:00:28
 Well,  yeah,  my  mother  was  almost  101  before  she  died.  You  know,  my  oldest  sister  now  is  about  93,  94.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:29-0:00:32
 Okay,  so  you  got  the  good  genes.  Yeah,  so  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:32-0:00:34
 figure  I'm  good  for  a  couple  more  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:34-0:00:46
 Oh,  yeah,  sure,  sure,  Ed.  So,  one  thing  that  I  had  in  mind,  Ed,  if  you  don't  mind  repeating  those  two  moments  of  interaction  that  you  had  with  Richard,  in  particular,  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:46-0:04:06
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:46-0:00:47
 thinking,  you  told  me,  let's  if

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:47-0:04:07
 see

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:47-0:00:53
 I  remember  correctly,  one  was  the  story  of  your  parents  were  managing  a  store.  Oh  yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:53-0:00:55
 yeah,  this  was  during  the  war.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:55-0:00:55
 about

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:55-0:00:57
 1944  I  guess  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:57-0:00:58
 was.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:58-0:01:02
 Yeah,  my  parents  owned  a  little  grocery  store.  Was  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:02-0:01:02
 in  Stockton?

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:02-0:01:12
 In  Stockton  on  North  Wilson  Way.  You  know  a  little  mom  and  pop  store  about  the  size  of  a  7 -eleven.  The  store  is  still  there  but  now  it's  a  liquor  store  I  believe.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:12-0:01:17
 Oh  is  it  still  there?  Do  you  remember  the  address?  I'm  curious.  Since  I'll  be  in  Stockton  maybe  I  can  drive  there.

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:17-0:01:25
 Yeah  it's  just  a  couple  it's  actually  two  blocks  north  of  Harding  Way  on  Wilson  Way.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:25-0:01:26
 Okay,  so...  It's  on

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:26-0:01:29
 Wilson  Way,  two  blocks  north  of  Harding  on  the  right  side.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:29-0:01:32
 Wilson  Way,  two  blocks  north.

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:32-0:01:39
 Yeah,  and  you'll  see  it's  the  only  liquor  store  there.  And  it's  on  the  right,  so  it  should  be  real  easy  to  find.  Okay,  thank  you.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:39-0:01:39
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:39-0:02:17
 No,  so  I  was  saying,  during  the  war,  you  know,  after  school,  I  used  to  go  over  there  and  work  in  the  store.  I  used  to  stock  shells  and  wait  on  customers.  So  I  was  telling  Rich  about  it  one  day,  and  he  said,  well,  man,  do  you  mind  if  I  come  over  with  you  someday  after  school?  I  said,  hey,  no,  that'd  be  great.  So  we  took  a  bus  from  school  and  went  out  to  the  store,  you  know,  and  and  I  uh  i  was  was  stocking  stocking  shells,  shells  and  and  old  old  Rich,  rich  he  he  was  was  really  all  he  was  really  excited  excited  about  about  it.  it  so  he  helped  me  stock  the  shells  you  know  and  i  just  showed  him  how  we  did  everything  yeah  uh  i  waited  on  customers  and  rich  was  standing  there  watching  everything

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:17-0:02:17
 oh  i

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:17-0:02:19
 i  think  he  loved  it  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:19-0:02:19
 know  i

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:19-0:02:23
 don't  think  he's  ever  had  that  kind  of  experience  before  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:23-0:02:31
 know  being  out  like  that  very  likely.  He  was  an  only  child.  Yeah.  Overprotected.  I  don't  think  he  would  have  any  kind  of  like...

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:31-0:02:45
 I  don't  think  he  had  a  social  life  you  know  after  I  talked  to  you  I  remembered  we  were  in  high  school  he  never  he  never  had  a  girlfriend  or  never  went  out  with  girls  and  never  went  to  any  of  the  school  dances.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:45-0:02:58
 I  want  to  ask  you,  Ed,  so  did  the  school  organize  like  dances,  events?  Because  from  some  of  the  pictures  on  the  yearbooks  that  I  saw,  it  looked  like  you  guys  were  going,  like  sometimes  it  looks  like  you  were  skiing  maybe?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  So  can  you  tell  me?  Yeah,  like

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:58-0:03:18
 we  would  have  school  dances  three  or  four  times  a  year,  and  we'd  have  a  senior  ditch  day.  I  think  pictures  I  sent  you  yes  were  from  a  senior  ditch  day  and  we  also  had  a  junior  senior  ditch  day  so  the  ones  I  sent  you  I  don't  know  if  they  did  you  any  good  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:18-0:03:21
 yeah  the  ones

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:21-0:03:43
 I  did  gave  you,  some  of  them  were  taken  at  Pinecrest  above  Sonora,  which  is  now  a  ski  resort  during  the  winter.  But  they  had  the  lake  there,  and  during  the  summer  we  used  to,  a  lot  of  high  school  guys  used  to  go  up  there.  Did

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:43-0:03:45
 you  guys  drive  there?  Yeah,  we

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:45-0:03:50
 used  to  drive.  We  hitchhiked  a  couple  of  times.  So  a  couple  of  us  hitchhiked  or  we  drove.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:50-0:03:56
 Can  I  ask  you,  how  old  did  you  have  to  be  at  that  time  to  drive?  You  had  to  be  18,  you  had  to  be  16?  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:56-0:03:58
 you  had  to  be  16  to  get  a  driver's

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:58-0:03:59
 license.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:59-0:04:15
 Yeah.  So  that's  when  I  got  mine.  I  know  my  older  brother  taught  me  how  to  drive.  My  folks  had  an  old  29  Buick.  And  we  used  to  call  it  the  bomber  in  high  school.  It  was  huge.  It  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:15-0:04:15
 big.

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:16-0:04:23
 Anyway,  those  pictures  were  taken  at  Pinecrest  and  some  of  those  pictures  was  during  Junior  Senior  ditch

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:23-0:04:24
 day,  and  they  were

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:24-0:05:03
 taken  at  Marsh  Creek.  Had  a  little  swimming  pool  and  a  little  kind  of  a  resort  area.  And  that  was  near  Walnut  Creek,  just  east  of  Walnut  Creek,  I  don't  know,  15,  20  miles.  But  it  was  an  easy  drive  from  Stockton.  So  we  had  school  activities  there.  But  yeah,  we  used  to  get  together,  but  Rich  wasn't  interested.  Couples  used  to  get  together  and  double  date  and  go  out.  We  used  to  rent  motor  scooters.  and  you  Do  know  just

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:03-0:05:05
 no

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:04-0:05:04
 they  have  a  lot

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:04-0:05:04
 water?

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:04-0:05:06
 of  no  No,  no,  motor  motor  scooters  scooters

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:06-0:05:07
 you  know  those  little  Honda  but  little

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:07-0:05:22
 they're  a  lot  different  than  they  were  today  you  know  well  they  were  just  little  small  motor  scooters  and  it  only  sat  two  people  they  wouldn't  go  very  fast  but  it  was  fun  riding  them  around  town  you  know  and  that  type  of  thing  so

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:22-0:05:25
 in  that  sense  like  Richard  wouldn't  participate  with  this  kind  of  activity?

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:25-0:05:43
 No,  I  haven't  seen  Rich.  I  don't  remember  seeing  Rich  at  any  of  the  Ditch  Days.  I  know  I  never  saw  him  at  a  school  dance,  or  I  never  saw  him  or  even  heard  of  him  going  out  on  a  date  with  girls.  I  think  his  mother  must  have  really  been  sheltering  him,  or  I  don't  know.

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:43-0:06:21
 Yeah,  I  mean,  mean  like  like,  unfortunately  unfortunately,  she  died  a  long  time  ago  and  she  was  the  youngest  daughter  of  a  large  family  but  so  she  was  the  youngest  one  all  the  others  died  earlier  and  Richard  was  an  only  child  and  they  had  him  when  they  were  already  old  like  for  that  time  actually  you  can  tell  me  for  a  couple  so  richard's  parents  got  married  relatively  young  but  they  had  him  15  years  after  oh  so  the  mother  was  30  almost  36.  how  common  was  i  mean  these  days  is  not  uncommon  for  a  couple  to  have  have  a  a  child?  child  oh  Oh  no  no

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:21-0:06:22
 no  no  no  no  yeah.  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:22-0:06:29
 at  At  that  that  time  time  was  was  it  it  was  was  it  it  kind  a  kind  of  of  uncommon  uncommon  for  for  a  a  couple  couple  that  that  had  had  been  been  married  married  for  for  15  15  years  years  to  to  have  their  first  child?  Oh  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:29-0:09:49
 geez

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:29-0:06:29
 don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:29-0:06:34
 know  I  don't  have  any  idea  tell  you  the  truth.  I  know  there  were  seven  kids  in  our  family.

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:34-0:06:36
 Okay.  I  think

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:36-0:06:40
 my  mother  had  them  when  she  started  at  about  18.  Okay

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:40-0:06:41
 so  yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:41-0:06:46
 But  I  really  don't  know,  because  I  can't  answer  that  question.  Did  Rich  ever  get  married?

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:46-0:06:47
 No,  he  didn't.

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:47-0:07:01
 Oh,  he  never  got  married?  I  thought  he  was  kind  of  a  loner.  Well,  he  had  friends  at  school,  but  they  were  all  like  myself  and  a  kid.  And  Richard  Huddleston,  there  was  a  picture  of  him  standing  next  to  Rich,

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:01-0:10:21
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:01-0:07:10
 believe,  in  the  yearbook.  But  I  think  Richard  Huddleston,  he's  dead  now,  but  I  think  that  he  was  one  of  Rich's  closest  friends.  Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:10-0:07:11
 is  he?

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:11-0:07:38
 Yeah,  and  I  think  they  used  to,  you  know,  they  kind  of  used  to  hang  out  together  during  recess.  But  I  don't  know  if  they  ever  went  out  together  or  did  anything  after  school  or  anything.  But  we  saw  them  quite  often.  I  saw  those  two,  Richard  Huddleston  and  Richard  Montague.  And  I  know  in  the  yearbook,  there's  a  picture  of  Rich.  And  Rich,  it  was  a  group  picture,  but  I  believe  they

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:38-0:07:38
 were

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:38-0:07:39
 standing  next  to  each  other.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:40-0:08:08
 I'll  check,  yeah.  OK.  Oh,  actually,  yeah.  Maybe  you  can  recognize.  I  think  I  remember  the  name  now  that  you  mentioned.  Because  there  were  so  many  names.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  I  think  I  made  a  copy.  I  mean,  these  are  like  bigger  copies  of  those  pictures,  so  the  quality  is  very  low.  Oh,  right.  Let's  see.  Let's  see.  Oh,  there's  Richard.  That's  That's  Rich.  Richard.  Yeah,  Yeah  these  these  are  are  all  all  pictures  pictures  with  with  Richard.  Richard.  Let's  Let's  see  see.  this  This  is.  is...  Yeah,  Yeah  there  there  he  he  is.  is.  Oh  Oh,  you  you  saw?  saw?  Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:08-0:11:28
 Yeah..

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:09-0:08:10
 So  that's  Richard  and  that's...  is

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:10-0:11:30
 This

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:10-0:08:10
 Richard

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:10-0:08:11
 Huddleston.

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:11-0:08:11
 these

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:11-0:11:31
 Oh

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:11-0:08:12
 are  the  two  Richards.

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:12-0:08:20
 Yeah  so  they  stayed  right...  That's  Rich  there  and  then  there's  Rich  Huddleston.  I  think  they  were  probably  better  friends  than  Rich  was  with

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:20-0:08:20
 anybody

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:20-0:08:27
 else.  You  know.  Boy  these  kids  are  actually  too  bad  you  couldn't  take  these  on  a  color  printer  or  something  well

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:27-0:08:29
 they're  yeah  they're  all  black  and  white  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:29-0:08:33
 but  I  mean  the  resolution  would  have  been  so  much  sharper  no

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:33-0:08:44
 no  so  okay  so  what  happens  is  this  is  actually  this  is  one  of  the  highest  possible  resolutions  it's  the  original  picture  that  there  are  like  because  the  original  remember  the  original  picture  that's  this  size  oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:44-0:08:45
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:45-0:08:45
 got  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:45-0:08:46
 increased  it.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:46-0:08:49
 I  got  you  like  easier  what

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:49-0:12:09
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:49-0:08:53
 happens  that  since  the  picture  was  not  that  high  quality  because  it  got  printed  on  a  book

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:54-0:08:54
 I  had

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:54-0:08:56
 the  negative  it  would  have  been  fantastic.

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:56-0:08:57
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:57-0:08:58
 probably  nobody  has  the  negative.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:58-0:08:59
 gotcha

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:59-0:09:03
 these  days  So  I  just  made  it  them  bigger,  but  oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:03-0:09:08
 I  thought  that  might  have  been  Bill  McFall,  but  I  don't  think  it  is.  I  know,  did  you  talk  to  Bill?

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:08-0:09:08
 talked

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:08-0:12:28
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:08-0:09:24
 to  him  by  email.  So  he  now  lives  in  northern,  north  of  here.  So  he  contacted  me  by  email,  and  we  had  a  little  bit  of  an  email  correspondence.  Oh,  good.  So  because,  you  see,  this  is  actually,  this  is  still  bigger,  but  this  is  closer.  Oh,  yeah,  that's  better.  Yeah,  that  looks  a  little  better.  It  And  then  gets  gets

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:24-0:12:44
 it

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:24-0:09:28
 a  a  little  little  bit,  bit  actually  actually,  original  originally,  is  a  little  bit  smaller.  Right  right.  Well

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:28-0:09:30
 good  I'm  glad  you  got  all  these  pictures.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:30-0:09:39
 Yeah  so  no  for  the  yearbook  was  very  useful  and  for  example  something  interesting  you  see  this  is  a  picture  from  the  the  War  Bond  Committee.  Oh  yeah  yeah.  1944 -1945.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:39-0:09:41
 Yeah  what  was  I  think  was  Richard  on  that  one?

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:41-0:09:48
 Interestingly  I  mean  they  list  all  the  names.  They  don't  list  his  name  I  know  you  know  I  think  I  noticed  that  too.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:49-0:09:51
 Yeah,  I  saw  Richard  and  I  said  I  wonder

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:51-0:10:03
 why  the  name  is  not  there.  No,  that's  him.  That's  rich  All  right,  and  I  one  more  question  for  you  in  case  I  know  it's  hard  to  do  But  I  found  another  picture,  you  know,  sometimes  the  yearbook  says  these  pictures  at  the  end  the  last  bit  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:03-0:10:07
 I  didn't  see  that  one.  Do  you  think  this  could  be  him  don't  you  think  that  oh

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:07-0:10:07
 that

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:07-0:10:15
 is  him  i  think  it's  him  oh  yeah  oh  yeah  that's  no  doubt  oh  okay  okay  no  doubt  that  that's  him  i  didn't  realize  that  he  rode  a  bike  to

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:15-0:10:15
 school

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:15-0:10:15
 so

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:15-0:10:17
 that's  that's  the  picture  was  important  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:17-0:10:21
 know  i  didn't  see  that  i  looked  at  i  looked  at  all  those  pictures  and  it's

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:21-0:10:23
 like  one  of  those  pictures  sometimes  in  the  year  at  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:23-0:10:24
 end  of  the  book  at

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:24-0:10:24
 the  of

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:24-0:13:44
 end

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:24-0:10:25
 the  the  book.  They

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:25-0:10:27

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:27-0:10:33
 Well,  I  missed  that.  I'm  sorry  I  missed  that.  Yeah,  that's  a  good,  actually,  that's  a  pretty  good  picture  of  him.

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:34-0:10:37
 Yeah,  I  know.  I  like  it.  So  this  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:37-0:10:45
 either  in  46  or  47.  Because  those  were  the  yearbook  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:45-0:10:50
 Those  were  the  only  two  yearbooks  I  had.  Ed,  I  forgot  to  mention  another  thing.  I  found,  when  I  went  to  St.  Mary's,  found

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:50-0:14:10
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:50-0:10:53
 the  43 -44.  Oh,  so  it

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:53-0:10:53
 wasn't  in  the

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:53-0:10:54
 yearbook.  this

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:54-0:14:14
 No,

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:54-0:10:56

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:09-0:11:15
 Can  you  tell  me  that  story?  Yeah,  during  assembly,  you  know.  We  used  to  have  assembly  for  the  whole  student  body  once  a  month.

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:15-0:11:16
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:16-0:11:53
 once  a  month  and  we'd  meet  in  the  assembly  room.  They  had  a  big  assembly  room  upstairs  and  Rich  was  the  official  accompanist.  But  he  would  also  he'd  always  play  this  high  classical  music  kind  of  stuff.  So  I  don't  know,  one  day  we  start  razzing  him  about,  hey  don't  you  know  any  boogie  woogie  or  can't  you  play  any  swing?  And  he  turned  around  and  looked  and  then  he  went  back  to  his  piano  and  he  started  to  pop  out  boogie  woogie  and  it  was  really  good.  Really?  By  ear.  He  played  everything  by  ear.  He  was  a  great  piano  player.  I  know  Mary  and  Benny  and  those  guys  will  probably  tell  you  the  same  thing.

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:54-0:11:57
 Yeah,  I'm  curious  to  hear  from  them.  You  know,  like  later  on...

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:58-0:12:17
 Well,  I'm  on  blood  thinner.  I've  had  some  heart  problems,  so  he  got  me  on  blood  thinner.  And  I  fell  yesterday.  And  every  time  I  bump  my  elbow,  I  break  the  skin.

 Let  me  go  clean  the  table.  Take

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:29-0:12:44
 your  time.  I  want  that  to  dry.  So,  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:44-0:12:45
 know  that

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:45-0:12:46
 picture  that  you  had

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:46-0:12:47
 of

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:47-0:12:48
 Birch  playing  the  piano?

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:48-0:12:59
 Yes.  Which  one  was  that?  That  was  taken  in  his  first  year.  It  was  1943 -44.  This  one,  here  it  is.

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:00-0:13:08
 Yeah,  see  with  all  the  kids  standing  around  there,  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  he  was  beating  out  a  little  swing  music  or  boogie  woogie.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:08-0:13:09
 Probably,

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:09-0:13:09
 probably.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:09-0:13:09
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:09-0:13:12
 because  that's,  you  know,  there's  Richard  Huddleson

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:12-0:13:14
 again.  They  were  pretty

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:14-0:13:16
 good  friends  I  think.  Anyway.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:17-0:13:23
 So  Richard  is  not  alive  anymore?  I  don't  see  his  name  in  the  list.  So  Richard  Huddleson.  No,  I  know

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:23-0:13:24
 he's  dead.  dead.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:24-0:13:24
 Is  Is  that

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:24-0:13:33
 right?  Yeah.  I  saw  that  in  the  school  annual  or  semi -annual  magazine  a  few  years  ago.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:34-0:13:37
 Do  you  know  if  he  stayed  in  Stockton  or  if  he  moved?  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:37-0:13:47
 don't  really  know  what  happened  to  him  at  all.  Maybe  Mary  or  Bernice  or  Benny  might  know,  but  I  don't  know.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:47-0:13:55
 So  can  I  ask  you,  going  back  to  when  he  was  playing  the  piano,  so  it  was  common  for  when  you  had  the  assembly?  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:55-0:14:11
 yeah,  he  was  the  official,  in  fact  I  think  in  the  yearbook  it  even  said  he  was  the  official  accompanist,  accompanist  at  the  assembly.  So  he  would  all  we'd  sing  songs  and  Rich  would  be  on  the  piano  playing  them.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:11-0:14:12
 So

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:12-0:14:26
 that  was  his  job.  So  I  think  Sister  David  asked  him  to  do  it  and  he  did  it.  So  yeah  he  usually  played  piano  every  time  once  a  month  when  we  were  you  know  had  the  assembly  because  I,  yeah,  we  always  sang  a  song  or  two.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:26-0:15:14
 Yeah,  you  know,  later  on,  I  mean,  like  people  that  got  to  know  him  later  in  college  or  when  he  was  a  professor  at  UCLA,  so  what  they  told  me  is  that  he  was  a  very  high -level  organist.  Oh  yeah.  In  fact,  I  think  in  his  last  year  in  Stockton  and  then  all  these  years  in  Berkeley  when  he  was  a  graduate  student  He  had  a  double  job.  He  was  working  as  a  graduate  student  and  then  he  was  hired  every  year  from  Different  like  Organist  yeah  the  master  of  music  Yeah,  I  think  I  have  a  teacher  here  I  lost  actually  I  don't  know  if  you  it's  a  very  poor  picture  I  tried  to  blow  it  up,  but  the  quality  of  the  picture  to  begin  with  is  very  poor  But  so  it's  here  it  is.  It's  a  senior.  It  was  from  your  yearbook  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:14-0:15:20
 slow  the  senior  choir  Well,  this  was  taken  in  the  cathedral  at  Right.  That's  what

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:20-0:15:21
 I  thought  right  next  door  to  St.

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:21-0:15:22
 Mary's.  Yeah,  do

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:22-0:15:28
 you  think  it's  possible?  I  know  it's  very,  this  is  Richard?  This  here?  Yeah,  the  one  in  the  back.  No,

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:28-0:15:30
 that  looks  like  a  girl.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:30-0:15:47
 Do  you  think  this  one  here?  I  wasn't  sure.  Oh,  I  can  tell.  Yes,  it's  totally  right,  because  what  I  saw,  I  got  the  transcripts.  St.  Mary's  gave  me  Richard's  transcripts,  and  I  noticed  that  in  his  last  year,  actually  for  the  last  two  years,  he  took  a  class  that  was  called  chorale.

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:47-0:15:49
 Chorale.  Which

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:49-0:16:03
 I  assume  that  it  had  to  do  with  choir.  And  I  know  that  Richard  was  hired  by  the  Catholic  Church  after  he  graduated  in  1947.  For  one  year,  he  was  hired  as  the  organist  and  the  choir  director.  So  it

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:04-0:16:07
 could  be.  If  you  look  at  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:07-0:16:16
 from  the  back.  It  has  a  small  frame.  Yeah,  but  I  couldn't  say  for  sure.  I  know.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:16-0:16:18
 I  remember  the  old  choir,  the  old  senior  choir.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:18-0:16:22
 So  there  was  a  choir  in  the  school  independently  from  the  church?

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:22-0:16:30
 Yeah,  yeah.  They  used  to  have  regular  choir  practices  during

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:30-0:16:31
 the  school  year.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:31-0:16:57
 Every  student  at  St.  Mary's  was  required  to  go  to  church.  Whenever  the  Catholics  went  to  church,  whether  you  were  Catholic  or  not,  you  had  to  attend  the  Mass  or  whatever  was  happening  in  the  church.  At  the  Masses,  the  choir  is  the  one  that  used  to  sing.  So,  you  know,  I  don't  know  if  Richard,  he  may  even  play,  I  don't  know  if  he  played  the  organ  or  at

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:57-0:17:08
 the  end.  I  know  for  sure  that  from  1947  to  1948,  the  Church  of  the  Annunciation  hired  him  officially  So  he  graduated.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:08-0:17:19
 Then  he  you  know,  of  course  the  choir  the  organ  wasn't  right  here  It  was  down  above.  Let  me  let  me  see  if  I  see  Mary  or  Benny  or  anybody  in  here  you  could  ask  them  tomorrow

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:19-0:17:23
 I'll  I'll  ask  ask  them  them,  definitely  definitely,  because  because  I  I  think  think  they  they  were  were  in  they  were  in  the  the  choir.  choir.  I

default: 0:17:23-0:17:23
 think

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:24-0:17:31
 Oh,  there's  Paul  DeCarli.  He's  the  guy  that  I  was  telling  you  was  also  a  professor  at  Stanford.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:31-0:17:35
 I  tried  to  contact,  actually.  Is  he

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:35-0:17:35
 still  alive?

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:35-0:17:37
 No,  Paul  died  three  years  ago.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:37-0:17:38
 That's  what  I  thought.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:38-0:17:57
 2013.  His  wife  and  his  children  are  alive,  so  I  tried  to  contact  his  wife,  but  I  got  the  back  but  now  I  think  I  found  his  son  I  just  wrote  him  yesterday  ah  son  lives  in  San  Francisco  so  okay  I  explained  what  it  is  and  maybe  he  may  have  some  material  or  something  we  may  remember  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:57-0:18:00
 I  don't  I  don't  see  Mary  Fiedland  or

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:00-0:18:10
 or  pretty  friendly  you  know  the  original  picture  is  a  small  one  and  right  quality  So  I  try  to  blow  it  up,  but  you  see  the  results.  Yeah,  anyway  So  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:10-0:18:10
 can't  help  you  out  there

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:11-0:18:13
 There's  been  really  great  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:13-0:21:33
 And

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:13-0:18:43
 have  the  same  question  about  in  general  like  for  whatever  you  remember  about  St  Mary's  and  also  about  the  way  about  St.  Mary's  and  your  experience  there  So  which  could  have  because  what  I  want  to  do  in  this  chapter,  I  would  like  to  describe  Richard  at  St.  Mary's  and  therefore  also  St.  Mary's,  what  it  meant  to  be  a  high  school  student  at  St.  Mary's.  How  was  the  life  there?  You  know,  like,  how  was  the  atmosphere?  For  example,  one  question  that  I  have  for  you  is  that  I  saw  from  the  yearbooks  that  you  were  heavily  involved  with  sports.  Yeah,  right.  I  mean,  you  were  in  a  variety  of  teams.  You  were  the  leader  and  so  on.

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:43-0:18:48
 In  fact,  I  was  inducted  into  the  St.  Mary's  Athletic  Hall  of  Fame.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:48-0:18:49
 don't  know.

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:49-0:18:51
 I  think  it  was  2006,  maybe  10

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:51-0:18:58
 years  ago.  Was  it  a  family  tradition  in  your  family  to  be  into  sports,  or  you  were  the  sports  you  were?

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:58-0:19:05
 Well,  my  brothers  also  played  sports,  but  I  was  a  better  athlete  than  them.  You  know,  they  played  basketball.  I  saw

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:05-0:19:08
 some  Baccarat  name.  How  do  you  pronounce  your  last  name?

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:08-0:19:11
 Barakat.  Barakat.  Yeah  my  brother  Tom  played  basketball.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:11-0:19:12
 saw  Tom,  yes.  And

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:12-0:19:12
 my  brother  Jim  played

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:13-0:19:16
 basketball.  Yes,  I  saw  them.  Yeah.  They  were  in  the  picture.  So

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:16-0:19:22
 but  I  played,  I  was  serious  about  it.  And  they  just  kind  of  played  it  as  a  hobby.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:22-0:19:24
 So  you  really  liked  it.  In

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:24-0:19:41
 fact,  I  put  in  more  time  in  sports  than  I  did  in  studying,  because  I'm  sorry  about  that  now,  because  I'm  not  as  smart  as  a  lot  of  other  people.  And  I  never  went  to  college  after.  I  don't  think  my  grades  would  have  let  me  in  anyway.  I  was  not  a  good  student,  student,  I  I  hate  hate

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:40-0:19:42
 to  to  say  say  it.  it.  But  But  you  you  loved  loved  sports.  sports.

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:42-0:20:04
 Yeah,  Yeah,  I  I  was  was  a  a  good  good  athlete,  athlete,  but  but  not  not  a  a  good  good  student.  No,  but  the  life,  you  know,  the  class,  our  class  had  only  55  kids  in  it.  So  yeah,  so  you,  and  in  the  whole  school,  I  bet  there  couldn't  have  been  more  than  300  students.  You  knew  almost  everybody  by  name,  you  know,  in  almost  every  class.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:04-0:20:28
 So,  Ed,  can  you  give  me  an  idea?  So  you  said  your  class  was  roughly  55  students.  Yeah.  You  know,  I  grew  up  in  Italy,  so  I'm  familiar  with  Italian.  Oh,  okay.  So  you  guys  were  55  of  you,  but  how  were  classes  structured?  Like,  for  example,  when  there  was  the  history  class  or  Latin  or  math,  all  you  55  were  divided  into  Oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:28-0:20:29
 units.  no,  no,

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:29-0:20:30
 no,  no,  no,  no,

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:30-0:20:55
 no,  no.  People  took  different  classes.  You  know,  so  I  think  the  classes  probably  didn't  have  more  than  25  people  in  each  class.  But  you  never  took  all  the  subjects  you  know  I  like  this  when  you  were  a  freshman  you  were  required  to  take  Latin  you  had  to  take  Latin  and  for  your  first  I  flunked  out  of  Latin  but  you  know  I  told  you  I'm  not  a  very  good  student  but  you  were  had  to

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:55-0:20:56
 take  Latin

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:56-0:21:25
 yeah  you  had  to  take  Latin  and  you  had  to  take  English  and  you  had  to  to  take  take  history  history  and  and  some  some  of  of  the  the  other  other  classes  classes  like  like  typing  typing  you  you  didn't  didn't  have  have  to  to  take  take  or  or  she  she  you  you  know  know  Mrs.  Ligori  I  think  she  might  have  taught  shorthand  so  you  ask  ask  Mary  and  Bernice  when  I  the  more  I  got  to  thinking  about  it  I  think  well  my  my  sister's  new  store  had  the  only  place  they  could  have  learned  it  was  in  high  school.  That's  probably

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:25-0:21:26
 where  Richard  learned

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:26-0:21:36
 shorthand.  Probably  Legorio,  the  only  lay  teacher  there,  probably  taught  typing  and  shorthand.  Ask  Mary  Ann  and  Bernice  tomorrow  when  you  see  them.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:37-0:21:41
 There  were  some  required  classes  and  then  you  guys  would  take—

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:41-0:21:49
 Yeah,  and  then  you  took  like  I  liked  algebra  and  I  liked  mechanical  drawing  you  didn't  have  to  take  mechanical  drawing  but

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:49-0:21:50
 it  was  an  option  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:50-0:22:06
 but  it  was  in  a  class  I  got  an  A  on  so  I  didn't  get  kicked  out  of  it  so  no  wonder  I  liked  it  right  I  think  Benny  might  have  taken  it  too  Benny  Valverde  but  mechanical  drawing,  drawing  I  I  believe  believe  it  it  was  was  mostly  mostly  for  for  boys  boys.  I  I  don't  don't  think  think  a  a  lot  lot  of  of  the  the  girls  girls  weren't  weren't  interested  interested  in  in  that.  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:06-0:22:09
 Who  was  teaching  mechanical  No,

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:09-0:22:17
 it  was  one  of  the  nuns.  But  I  forget  which  nun  it  was  actually,  to  tell  you  the  truth.  It  might  have  been  Sister  Jordan.  But

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:17-0:22:18
 it  was  definitely  a  nun.

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:18-0:22:23
 Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  Because  the  only  thing  Liguori  taught  was  typing  and  shorthand.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:23-0:22:23
 That's

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:23-0:22:24
 the  only  class  she

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:24-0:22:33
 had.  What  memories  do  you  have  of  those  teachers,  of  those  nuns?  Were  they  kind  or  more  on  the  severe  side?

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:33-0:23:19
 No,  no,  none  of  them  were,  they  were  all  serious,  I  know  that.  They  were  all  serious,  and  a  couple  of  them  had  a  pretty  good  sense  of  humor,  But  they  never  gave  you  a  hard  time.  Even  if  you  got  out  of  line,  you  went  into  the  principal's  office  and  Sister  David  would  of  course  chew  your  butt  upside  down.  She'd  never  threaten  anything.  But  no,  they  were  all  really  good  good  nuns  nuns.  and  they  They  were  were  good  good  teachers  teachers  and  and  they  they  really  really  knew  knew  their  their  business.  business  and  I've  I've  never  never  seen,  seen  except  except  for  for  the  the  one  one  nun  nun  I  told  you  about  that  incident  about  when  I  knocked  the  sister  Gregory's  flower  pot  that  was  the  only  time  I  ever  saw  a  nun  get  mad  that's  it  in  all  my  four  years  that  was  the  only  time  that  she

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:19-0:23:24
 yeah  it  was  a  freshman  yeah  told  me  that  you  were  playing  with  a  friend  of  yours.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:24-0:23:25
 Eddie  Eddie  Brennan.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:25-0:23:27
 I  think  his  picture's  in  there.  Eddie  Brennan.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:27-0:23:28
 You  guys

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:28-0:23:29
 were  playing  together.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:29-0:23:33
 Yeah,  well  we  were  just,  we  were  in  class.  Class  hadn't  started  yet,

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:33-0:23:33
 and

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:33-0:23:58
 we  were  just  horse  playing,  you  know,  kind  of  shoving  each  other  around.  So  she  had  this  pot  on  the  windowsill,  and  the  window  was  open.  So  Eddie  kind  of  gave  me  a  shove  and  I  went  over  the  window  and  I  knocked  the  pot  off  and  it  fell  down  in  two  stories  and  broke  on  the  cement.  And  that's  the  only  time  I  ever  saw  any  nun  really  get  personally  mad.  In  fact  she  came  over  and  slapped  my  face.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:58-0:24:02
 So  do  you  remember  which  nun?  It  was  Sister  Gregory.

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:02-0:24:04
 Hell,  I'll  never  forget  her.

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:04-0:24:05
 You  kidding?

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:05-0:24:07
 Boy,  and  how.

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:08-0:24:17
 I  know  that  it's  a  long  time  ago  and  you  were  very  young,  but  do  you  have  a  sense  of  how  old  those  nuns  could  have  been?  Are  we  talking  about  your  parents'  age?

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:18-0:24:50
 Yeah,  they  were  probably,  I  would  say,  30s  and  40s.  I  think  Sister  David  might  have  been  in  her  early  50s,  but  I'm  trying  to  think,  was  there  an  old  one  there?  I  think  Sister  Jordan  was  the  oldest  one,  and  she  might  have  been  in  her  late  50s  or  early  60s,  but  all  the  other  nuns  were,  you  know,  I  don't  think  any  of  them  were  in  their  20s,  but  I  think  probably  most  of  them  were  in  their  30s  and  40s.  That's  my  recollection.  Mary  and  the  girls  would  probably  know  more  about  that  than  I  do.

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:51-0:25:01
 I  have  a  question  about  St.  Mary's  and  the  people  that  would  go  to  St.  Mary's.  St.  Mary's  was,  and  still  is,  a  Catholic  high  school,  but  it  was  also  open  to  non -Catholics.

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:01-0:25:08
 Oh,  yeah,  anybody.  It  was  open  to  anybody,  but  whether  you  were  a  Catholic  or  not,  you  had  to  take  the  religion  class.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:09-0:25:10
 You  had  to  take  it  anyway.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:10-0:25:20
 and  you  had  to  go  to  church  when  the  whole  school  went  to  church.  And  that  was  the  agreement  when  you  signed  up.  This  kid,  Bob  Sherwood.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:20-0:25:21
 Bob  Yes.  Bob

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:21-0:25:55
 Sherwood  Sherwood  was  was  a  a  very  very  religious  religious  guy.  guy.  And  he  actually,  after  he  got  out  of  college,  he  became  a  Protestant  minister.  You  know,  and  I  think  he's  living  up  in  Grass  Valley  someplace,  and  I  don't  know  if  he's  still  alive  even.  But  anyway,  during  religion  class,  Sister  David  used  to  teach  religion  class,  and  Bob  Sherwood  challenged  her  on  almost  every  one  of  the  Catholic  teachings,  and  he  really  made  some  pretty  good  points,  but  of  course  Sister  David  countered,  and  it  was  fun  to  watch  the  two  go  at  it,  you  know.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:55-0:26:02
 And  Sister  David  would  let  the  student  engage  her?  She  wouldn't  stop  him,  say,  would  you  say,  shut  up,  don't...

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:02-0:26:31
 Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no.  They  used  to  have  a  discussion  one -on -one.  It  was  none  of  that.  They  could  say  whatever  they  wanted,  especially  the  non -Catholics  that  challenged  her.  She'd  listen  to  them,  and  she'd  answer  them  back,  and  they'd  answer  her.  Sherwood,  he  was  famous  for  that.  In  almost  every  religion  class  that  that  I  I  had  had  that  that  he  he  was  was  there,  there.  He  he  was  was  always  always  in  in  there.  there,  you  know.  But  But  we  we  never  never  went  went  to  to  religion  religion  class  class  every  day,  you  know,  maybe  once  a  week  or  twice  a  week  or  something  like  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:32-0:26:37
 Do  you  remember  taking  any  class  with  Richard?  Any

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:37-0:26:38
 what?

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:38-0:26:40
 Have  you  taken  any  class  with  Richard?

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:40-0:26:46
 With  Richard?  Yeah.  Well,  yeah,  I  think  he  was  in  mechanical  drawing  and  he  might  have  been  in  algebra  and  some  of  those  classes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:47-0:26:54
 So  do  you  remember  if  he  was  already  brilliant  at  that  point?  Because  later  he  became  a  very  brilliant  student  when  he  was  a  student.  Oh  you  mean  Richard  Montague?  Richard  Montague.  Oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:54-0:26:56
 yeah,  I  thought  you  were  talking  about  Sherwood.

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:56-0:27:01
 No,  no,  Richard  Montague.  Sorry,  Richard  Montague.  Have  you  taken  any  class  where  there  was  Richard  Montague  in?

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:01-0:27:09
 Yeah,  I  think  I  took  an  algebra  class  with  him  in  geometry.  He  was  smart,  absolutely.

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:09-0:27:10
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:10-0:27:32
 think  he  was  probably  one  of  the  smartest  in  that  whole,  in  our  whole  senior  class.  He  got  straight  A's,  you  know,  and  he  made  that  honor  society  every  month  from  every  month,  you  know,  from  a  freshman  through  our  senior  year  and  you  had  to  get  all  A's  and  some  B's  I  think  to  make  it  and  I  think  Rich  was  probably  straight  A  student.

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:32-0:27:34
 Yeah  I  checked  his  transcripts.  Was  all  A's?  Yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:34-0:27:47
 that's  what  I  said  I  think  he  was  that's  what  I  remember  about  he  is  smartest  guy  in  the  school  you  know  and  he  played  the  piano  well  and  the  only  thing  is  he  just  didn't  socialize  much  or  go  out  with  girls.

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:47-0:27:58
 Based  on  what  you  remember,  based  on  my  experience  in  high  school,  I  remember  that  there  were  two  kinds  of  people  that  didn't  socialize.  There  were  the  people  that  were  very,  very  shy.  Those  that  were  very,  very  shy.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:58-0:27:59
 think  Rich  might  have  been  shy.

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:00-0:28:12
 And  then  there  are  people  that  just  feel  like,  how  can  you  describe  that?  One  that  says,  you  are  not  good  enough  for  me.  Okay?  You  know,  those  people  that  have  that  kind  of  attitude  or  like  way  above  you,  so  I  don't  want  to  do  that.  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:12-0:29:07
 no,  nobody  ever  had  an  opinion  about  Rich  like  that.  I  think  we  probably  figured  out,  well,  you  know,  he's  probably  really  shy  and  wasn't  interested  in  going  out  with  girls  or  going  to  dances.  But  never  did  anybody  ever  think  that  he  was  different  or  he  was  a  bad  guy  and  you'd  want  to  associate  with  him.  Now  you'd  be  lucky  if  he  would  have  you  as  his  friend  to  tell  you  the  truth.  You  really  would,  yeah.  We  got  along  really  good,  you  know.  He  wanted  to  go  at  the  store  with  us.  Yeah,  in  algebra,  I  think  I  even  had  a,  you  know,  I  had  him  help  me  with  algebra  a  couple  of  times.  So,  the  guy  was  smart.  I  think  Mary  and  Bernice  and  Benny  will  tell  you  the  same  thing,  that  he  might,  they  might  have  thought  that  he  was  probably  the  smartest  one  in  the  whole  class,  too.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:07-0:29:19
 was  intrigued  by  what  you  told  me  about  the  day  that  you  guys  went  to  the  store  together.  Oh,  yeah.  I  was  wondering,  one  of  the  tasks  that  you  guys  did  together  was  to  arrange  things  on  shelves?

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:19-0:29:43
 Yeah,  yeah.  Whenever  any  of  the  inventory  was  low,  we  went  in  the  back  room  and  got  the,  like,  if  we're  stacking  canned  corn  or  solar  pop  or  whatever  it  was,  we  used  to  go  in  the  back  room  and  get  the  case  and  bring  it  out  to  the  shelf  and  take  it  out  of  the  case  and  mark  the  price  on  it  and  put  it  on  the  shelf.  So  Rich  helped  me  take  it  out  of  the  case,  and  I  said,

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:43-0:33:03
 You

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:43-0:29:51
 mark  the  price.  your  handwriting  is  better.  So  he  used  to  mark  the  prices  on,  you  know,  the  cans  or  whatever  it  was  we  were,  you  know,  we  were  stacking.

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:51-0:30:43
 Because  later  on  in  his  life,  you  see  when  his  mind  develops,  you  see  a  great  fascination  for  everything  that  is  organized  and  systematic.  Oh  yeah.  Everything  that  has  a  rule.  Oh  yeah,  yeah.  You  know  know  in  his  own  job  and  academic  achievement  but  also  in  other  things  for  example  a  friend  told  me  that  when  they  got  married  Richard  was  who  was  at  the  wedding  and  at  a  certain  point  his  friend  of  Richard  he  was  very  much  into  Scottishness  oh  and  so  Richard  that  it  was  not  familiar  with  it  a  Scottish  dance  is  one  of  those  dance  that  you  do  in  a  group  using  very  geometric  patterns.  Oh,  right.  Okay.  And  Richard  got  completely  obsessed  with  it.  Fascinated.  Really?  He  learned  the  rules  and  got  himself  engaged.  Like  he  tried  to  dance  following  the  rules.  Whoa,  good  for  him.  So  there  is  this  fascination  for  like  this  geometric  regular  patterns.  Yeah.  Was  this

SPEAKER_01: 0:30:43-0:30:44
 in  college  or?  This

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:44-0:31:03
 was  after  college.  After  college.  Oh,  okay.  It  was  1969,  so  Richard  was  38.  Oh,  okay.  He  was  already  a  professor  at  UCLA,  and  the  guy  was  a  young  visiting  professor  that  came  to  UCLA  to  study  with  Richard  during  his  sabbatical.  Right.  And  so  they  became  very  close,  actually,

SPEAKER_01: 0:31:02-0:34:22
 And

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:03-0:31:22
 UCLA,  this  young  professor  also  found  his  new  wife,  his  first  wife.  And  they  got  married.  And  Richard  was  invited  to  the  wedding  in  Los  Angeles.  Oh.  And  that's  where,  and  both,  the  young  professor,  his  name  is  Max.  And  both  Max  and  his  wife  were  very  much  into  Scottish  dance.  Richard  didn't  know  about  it.  when

SPEAKER_01: 0:31:22-0:34:42
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:22-0:31:27
 they  saw,  when  he  saw  them  dance  and  asked,  like,  does

SPEAKER_01: 0:31:27-0:34:47
 how

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:27-0:31:38
 it  work?  And  so  Max  explained  to  him  the  rules  and  Richard  was  totally  fascinated,  memorized  the  pattern,  wanted  to  follow  the  pattern.  Good  for  him.  Good  for  him.  I  very  much  enjoyed  it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:31:39-0:31:54
 Well,  I  think,  you  know,  that's  what  I  was  saying.  I  thought  when  we  went  over  to  the  store  after  school,  he  was  really  excited  about  it.  You  know,  he'd  never  done  anything  like  that  before.  And  man,  he  was  all  smiled,  you  know,  and  he  enjoyed  that.  So,

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:54-0:32:06
 one  thing  I  want  to  ask  you,  since  you  were  very  much  into  sports,  and  you  have  an  idea,  and  I  see  that  the  yearbook  spends  quite  a  bit  of  pages  on  sports  and  athletics.  How  important  was  sports  at  St.  Mary's  in  those  years?

SPEAKER_01: 0:32:06-0:33:33
 Well,  it  was  pretty  important.  You  know,  we  really  had  a  small  amount  of  students.  And  some  of  the  teams  we  fielded,  like  the  basketball  teams,  were  really  good.  And  when  I  was  there  playing  football,  our  football  teams  were  not  very  good  because  we  never  had  that  many  guys  going  out  for  them.  Some  of  our  teams,  I  remember  going  to  Doss  Palace,  playing  Doss  Palace,  and  we  only  had  20  guys.  We  never  had  the  volume  of  players.  Just  a  lot  of  guys  wanted  to  go  out  and  play,  And  we  never  won  a  lot  of  games,  football  games.  Now,  basketball  was  different.  We  had  some  great  basketball  athletes  like  the  Toso  twins  and  Glenn  Miller.  They  were  terrific.  In  fact,  one  of  the  Tosos  was  inducted  in  the  Hall  of  Fame,  the  Athletic  Hall  of  Fame.  And  so  we  had  championship  basketball  teams.  And  baseball  teams,  we  had  a  pretty  good  team.  Toso's  were  also  outstanding  in  baseball.  We  probably  won  more  games  than  we  lost.  But  I  think  for  the  people  that  participated  in  it,  it  was  important.  You  know,  we  always  get  a  nice  little  write -up  in  the  Stockton  record,  you  know,  about  the  team,  whether  we  won  or  lost.  So  everybody  was,  you  know,  at  least  the  athletes  were  tickled  pink  to  see  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:37-0:33:41
 Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:41-0:33:55
 football.  I  love  football,  yeah.  I  played  football,  basketball,  and  I  tried  baseball  in  my  freshman  year.  I  didn't  care  for  baseball.  So  I  only  played  baseball  one  year,  but  I  played  basketball  and  football  for  three  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:55-0:34:04
 So  if  you  were  an  athlete  like  you,  would  St.  Mary's  give  you  like  fellowships?  Or  you  had  to  pay  the  regular  fees?

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:04-0:34:10
 Yeah,  there  was  no  scholarship.  Not  for  St.  Mary's  athletes,  absolutely  not.

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:10-0:34:21
 Do  you  remember,  because  I'm  trying  to  get  a  sense  of  how  difficult  it  was  for  a  family  to  send  a  kid  to  St.  Mary's.  Do  you  remember  if  St.  Mary's  was  expensive?  It  was  a  private  school,  but  was  it  expensive?  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:21-0:35:15
 no,  actually  there  were  seven  of  us  kids  that  went  to  St.  Mary's  High  School.  When  my  older  sister  and  brother  started,  I  think  the  tuition  was  like  three  dollars  a  month  each.  Three  dollars  a  month  each.  When  my  other  two  sisters,  no  in  fact  I  think  it  was  $2,  because  when  my  other  sisters,  there  was  my  brother  and  myself  and  my  two  sisters,  there  was  four  of  us  in  high  school  at  the  same  time.  So  my  mother  went  and  met  with  Monsignor  McGough  and  said,  you  know,  my  parents  didn't  have  a  lot  of  money  in  those  days.  They  said,  well,  we  really  can't  pay  a  lot  of  tuition.  So  he  says,  okay.  He  says,  can  you  pay  $6  a  month  for  all  four?  So  that's  what

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:15-0:35:16
 they  paid.  They

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:16-0:35:17
 paid  $6  a  month.

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:17-0:35:21
 So  the  regular,  you  thought  it  was  like  $2  or  $3  a  month?

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:21-0:35:28
 Yeah,  when  my  older  sister  started  started  it  was  something  like  that.  I  know  it  was  a  lot  less  than  six  dollars  because  that

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:28-0:35:29
 was  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:29-0:35:42
 max  that  they  ever  paid.  And  of  course  when  my  oldest  brother  graduated  they  never  reduced  the  tuition,  it  was  still  six  bucks.  And  when  my  two  sisters  graduated  it  was  still  six  bucks,  so  that  was  fair.

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:43-0:36:08
 I  know,  it  was  the  family  contribution.  Yeah,  so  that  was  good.  That's  it.  And  so  going  back  to  playing  sports,  if  you  were  a  guy  in  St.  Mary's  and  you  were  not  playing  sports,  first  of  all,  the  majority  of  guys  at  St.  Mary's  played  sports,  or  it  was  just  a  little  group,  an  elite?  No,

SPEAKER_01: 0:36:08-0:36:23
 not  the  majority.  Just  the  boys  that  liked  athletics  played  sports,  and  that  was  not  the  majority.  In  fact,  it  was  surely  a  minority.

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:23-0:36:33
 Did  you  guys  also  have  teams,  what  are  called,  like  the  teams  that  don't  compete  with  other  schools  but  just...  Intramural.  Intramural.  Yeah,  yeah,  that's  what  I  was  telling  you.  Rich

SPEAKER_01: 0:36:33-0:36:35
 was  on  an  intramural  team  one  year.

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:35-0:36:35
 Uh -huh.

SPEAKER_01: 0:36:35-0:36:36
 Do

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:36-0:36:39
 you  remember  what  kind  of  sports  that  could  have  been?  It  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:36:39-0:36:39
 softball.

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:39-0:36:42
 Did  you  convince  him  or  it  was  just...  No,  no,  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:36:42-0:37:00
 don't,  and  you  know  what?  I  don't  really  know  why  he  decided  to  play,  but  he  only  played  one  year.  And  we  used  to  play  just  the  other  classes,  like  the  seniors  play  the  juniors,  and  the  juniors  the  sophomores,  and  so  forth.  And  every  year  there  was  a  school  championship,

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:01-0:37:01
 whether  it  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:01-0:37:50
 the  seniors  or  the  juniors.  They  had  a  regular  little,  I  don't  know,  tournament  or  something  set  up  so  you  played  every  other  team  and  whoever  won  the  most,  I  guess,  was  a  school  champ.  So  in  our  junior  year  we  had  a  terrific  softball  pitcher.  Now  he  became  pro  after  he  graduated,  made  the  big  time.  And  we  were  juniors  there  and  this  guy's  name  was  Bill  Simone.  And  when  he  pitched,  the  seniors,  you  know,  they  had  all  the  good  athletes.  They  had  the  Tosos  and  Miller  and  Arby.  All  the  good  athletes  were  seniors  when  we  were  juniors.  But  we  had  the  one  pitcher.  So  the  softball  pitcher  during,  when  we  played  the  seniors,  the  softball  pitcher  didn't  let  him  get  one  hit.  So  we  him  good  so  we  became  actually  became  intramural  champions  that  year  when

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:50-0:37:51
 we  were  juniors  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:51-0:37:56
 I  remember  I  don't  think  we're  champions  we  were  seniors  but

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:56-0:37:59
 Richard  joined  you  guys  when  he  was  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:59-0:38:04
 don't  know  you  know  I'm  not  really  sure  what  year  he  played.  It  might  have  been  junior  or  senior.  I'm

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:04-0:38:05
 really  not  sure.  remember,

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:05-0:41:25
 Do  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:05-0:38:09
 were  you  in  the  very  same  team  when  he  played  in  the  softball  team?  Yeah,  we  had

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:09-0:38:20
 to  be,  but  I  don't  really  remember  Rich  actually  getting  in  and  playing  a  lot.  I  just  don't  remember.  I  wish  I  could  answer  that,  but  I  can't

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:20-0:38:25
 recall  that.  Do  you  remember,  was  Richard  kind  of  clumsy  with  his  body?  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:25-0:38:27
 he  was  not  athletic.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:29-0:41:49
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:29-0:39:09
 don't  know.  I  hate  to  say  he  kind  of  moved  like  a  feminine  or  something,  but  not  really.  He  just  not  athletic.  I  don't  think  he  ever  did  any  of  the  exercises  that  the  athletes  did.  I'm  surprised.  I  don't  even  remember  him  riding  his  bike  to  school,  to  tell  you  the  truth.  I  don't  know.  I  can't  answer.  I  don't  think  he  was  very  athletic  at  all,  for  whatever  reason.  I  don't  think  he  ever  got  involved  in  athletics  except  for  just,  just  that  one  year.  And  he  probably  played  out  in  the  outfield  somewhere.  I  don't  remember  him

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:09-0:39:09
 getting

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:09-0:39:11
 up  at  bat  or  anything.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:11-0:39:17
 So  one  question  that  has  to  do  with  before  St.  Mary's.  Do  you  remember  which  school  you  went  to  before  St.  Mary's?

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:18-0:39:19
 Well,  I  went  to  a  public  school.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:19-0:39:20
 and  do  you  remember  the  name  of  that  public  school?  Oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:20-0:39:22
 yeah,  I  went  to,  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:22-0:39:24
 was  in  Stockton,  it  was  Lincoln

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:24-0:39:43
 Grammar  School,  one  to  sixth  grade,  and  then  I  had  to  go  over  to  Jefferson  School  through  the  seventh  and  eighth  grades.  So  I  had  to  go  six  years  to  public  school,  and  then  two  years  to  a  public  school,  then  we  went  into  St.  Mary's  in  a  Catholic  school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:43-0:40:07
 One  question  that  I  have  for  you  is,  do  you  remember  if  at  that  time  in  Stockton,  because  I  got  the  transcripts,  and  the  transcripts,  the  St.  Mary's  transcripts,  say  the  school  where  you  come  from,  it  says  where  previous  training,  it's  under  the  label  previous  training,  that  indicates  which  school  the  student  was  coming  from.  And  in  the  case  of  Richard,  they  wrote  El  Dorado.

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:07-0:40:09
 Oh,  that  was  El  Dorado.  It  was  a  public  school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:09-0:40:10
 So  El  Dorado  was  a  public  school?  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:10-0:40:16
 yeah,  it's  on  the  corner  of  Harding  Way  and  Pacific  Avenue.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:16-0:40:19
 So  a  public  school  similar  to  the  one  you  went  to?  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:19-0:40:22
 no,  El  Dorado  was  an  eight -year  school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:23-0:43:43
 You

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:23-0:40:23
 go  there  from  one...

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:24-0:40:24
 First  to  eighth  grade.

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:24-0:40:30
 Yeah,  because  that's  where  my  daughter  went  when  she  was  younger.  Okay.  So,  yeah,  that  was  a  full  eight -year  school.  Okay.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:30-0:40:30
 So  he

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:30-0:40:31
 came  from  El  Dorado.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:32-0:43:52
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:32-0:40:32
 didn't  know  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:32-0:40:43
 Well,  actually,  I  think  what  happened  is  that  I  know  for  sure  that  up  to  a  certain  grade,  he  went  to  Jackson  School.  You  know,  Jackson  School  was  a...  I  think  it  was  from  one  to  eighth  grade,  but  it  was  south.

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:44-0:40:47
 It  was  in  south.  Yeah,  Jackson  Grammar  School  was  in  South.  Yes,

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:47-0:41:00
 and  the  parents  were  living  there.  Richard  lived  there  with  the  parents  until  he  was  10  or  11.  Oh,  okay.  Then  they  moved  very  close  to  St.  Mary's.  Okay.  So  that  was  in  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:00-0:41:01
 Eldorado  School  District.

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:01-0:41:20
 In  the  Eldorado  School  District.  Now  it  makes  sense  why.  So  probably  he  went  for  like  four  or  five  grades.  He  went  to  Jackson.  Sorry,  what's  it  called?  Yes,  Jackson  School,  when  they  were  living  there.  Right.  Then  the  family,  I  think,  became  a  little  bit  wealthier,  was  able  to  buy  a,  I  guess,  you  know,  the  neighborhood  got  better  because  it  was  close  to  St.  Mary's.  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:20-0:41:25
 yeah.  Eldorado  School  is  a  good  neighborhood.  They  have  some  nicer  homes  out  there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:25-0:41:30
 In  fact,  they  got  a  home.  Yeah.  And  so  they  used  to  live  in  what's  called  a  duplex.

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:30-0:41:31
 Yeah.  You  know  what  street  that  was  on?

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:31-0:41:43
 Yes.  Let  me  see.  I  have  to  map  in  my  mind.  It's  two  blocks  from  where  Jackson  School  used  to  be.

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:44-0:41:47
 Oh,  you  mean  in  South  Stockton  when  they  lived  down  South

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:47-0:42:14
 Stockton?  No,  the  house  where  they  end  up  going  is  there  was  right  next  to  the  Church  of  the  Annunciation  is  on  a  street  called  Van  Buren.  Oh  yeah,  Van  Buren.  It's  like  I  went  to  see  it  you  know  and  now  Van  Buren  there  is  the  square  in  front  of  the  the  Church  church,  of  and  they  build  that  medical  facility.  And  so  the  house  used  to  be  where  now  there  is  one  of  the  medical  facilities.  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:14-0:42:22
 now,  wait.  Now,  I  don't  think  we're  talking  about  the  cathedral  at  the  Annunciation.  I  don't  think  there's  a  medical  facility  across  the  street  from  that?  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:22-0:42:28
 There  Okay.  is,  okay,  if  If  you  you  are  are  at  at  the  the  entrance  entrance  of  of  the  the  church,  church,  there  there  is  is  one  one  on  on  the  right.

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:28-0:42:31
 Oh  okay,  over  on  that  side.

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:31-0:42:37
 And  if  you  cross  the  square,  on  the  other  side,  there  is  something  like,  is  that  like  medical  offices?  Right,

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:37-0:42:39
 okay,  I  thought  you  were  talking  directly

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:39-0:42:40
 across  the  street  from  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:40-0:42:40
 main

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:40-0:42:41
 entrance.  No,  no,

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:41-0:46:01
 no,

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:41-0:42:59
 so  if  you  cross  the  square,  like  there  are  these  medical  offices  that  are  right  on  the  corner,  and  I  think  there  were  at  least  two  or  three  homes  there.  And  I  think  the  Montague's  home  was,  if  not  the  last  one,  the  one  before  the  last  one.  So  the  house  got  destroyed,  but  the  neighborhood  was  the  neighborhood  which  was  definitely  better  than  the  previous  neighborhood.  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:59-0:42:59
 yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:59-0:43:00
 that's  a

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:00-0:43:06
 nice,  they  had  some  nice  houses.  Of  course  in  those  days,  you  know,  during  the  40s,  those,  those  were  really  nice  houses.

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:06-0:43:13
 Where  did  your  family  live  at  that  time?  When  you  were  going  to  the  Annunciation,  sorry,  to  St.  Mary's?  Well,  we

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:13-0:43:53
 lived  on  East  Main  Street  in  Stockton,  which  isn't  even  close  to  St.  Mary's.  We  had  to  take  a  bus  and  transfer  once.  So  we  lived  in  the  1400  block  on  East  Main,  just  a  block  off  of  Wilson  Way.  You  know,  and  I'm  telling  you  about  my  parents  market.  Well  Wilson  Way  was  one  block  from  where  we  lived,  but  if  you  go  north  about  about  a  a  mile  mile  and  and  a  a  half  half  or  or  maybe  maybe  two  two  miles  miles,  that's  that's  where  where  the  the  store  store  was.  was.  Because  it  was,  I  think  it  was  like  in  the  1700  or  1800  block,  I'm  not  sure.  But  it's  two  blocks  north  of  Harding  Way.  So  when

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:53-0:43:56
 you  guys  were  going  to  school  you  would  take  the  bus?

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:56-0:43:58
 We'd  take  the  bus,  oh  yeah,  we  would  take  a  bus.

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:58-0:44:01
 Was  there  anybody  that  was  going  to  school  by  car?

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:02-0:44:04
 Well  in  high  school  there  was.

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:04-0:44:04
 Yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:04-0:44:05
 there

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:04-0:44:05
 in  high  school.

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:05-0:44:17
 Yeah,  there  was.  Charlie  Risseau  was,  and  one  of  the  Wallaces.  I  forget  which  one.  In  fact,  there  was  a  picture  in  the  yearbook  of  a  couple  of  cars  that  were  parked  next  to  the  school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:17-0:44:20
 I  was  wondering.  Yeah.  So  those  could  have  been  students'  cars.

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:20-0:47:40
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:20-0:44:20
 You

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:20-0:44:22
 want  me  to  go  get  those  and  show

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:22-0:44:24
 you?  Yeah,  sure,  sure,  sure.  Show  you  which

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:47-0:44:55
 I  know  Charlie  Rizzo  had  his  own  car.  ones  it  was  Their  parents  owned  a  real  nice  restaurant,  so  they  were  considered  really  wealthy,

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:55-0:45:01
 you  know.  Additionally,  Ed,  about  being  wealthy,  do  you  have  sense

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:01-0:48:21
 a

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:01-0:45:08
 that  the  people  that  were  at  St.  Mary's,  as  far  as  the  economic  status  was  concerned,  was  there  variations?

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:08-0:45:16
 Yeah,  most  of  them.  Actually,  most  were  just  low  income.  And  then  there  were  some  pretty  well -off  people,  and  then  there  was  a  lot  of  middle  class

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:16-0:45:17
 in  there.  It

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:17-0:45:27
 was  really  a  mix.  Okay.  Now,  this  Jeep  in  here  belonged  to  a  guy  named  Peter  Maringo.  A  student?  Yeah,  he  was  a  student.  Okay,  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:27-0:45:27
 see  that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:28-0:45:40
 So  he  had  the  car.  That's  another  car,  clearly.  Yeah,  I  don't...  Well,  that  was  Elodie  Russell.  That  was  her  parents'  car.  That's

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:40-0:45:40
 Elodie  Russell.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:40-0:45:48

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:48-0:45:49
 going  to  meet  tomorrow.  Then  I'm  going  to  have  to  tomorrow.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:52-0:45:53
 up  in  the  mountains.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:53-0:46:00

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:19-0:46:26
 their  parent's  car.  Actually,  can  I  ask  you  about  driving?  Was  it  common  in  those  days  for  a  woman  to  drive  or  it  was  mainly  a  man  activity?

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:26-0:46:27
 No,  no,  yeah,  girls  were  driving.

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:27-0:46:28
 Okay,  we'll  take  that.

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:28-0:46:39
 Girls  could  drive.  They  didn't  have  any  problem.  Let's  see,  I  thought  there  was  another  car  in  here  of  Charlie  Riffsoff.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:39-0:46:39
 don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:39-0:46:40
 remember  seeing  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:42-0:46:44
 Now  these  are  two  girls  here.

SPEAKER_01: 0:46:47-0:47:16
 Yeah  I'm  not  sure  whose  car  that  is  there.  You  know  might  have  been  one  of  these  gals.  That's  Frances  Chisholm  was  in  our  class.  And  Nadine  Presto,  she  was  a  year  behind  us,  I  believe.  Oh,  there's  Peter  Marengo.  There's  Bill  McFall,  I  believe.  You  talked  to

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:16-0:47:17
 Bill.  Yes.

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:19-0:47:22
 There's  Don  Gamboni.  Yes,

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:22-0:47:25
 yes,  yes.  I  remember.  He  looks  like  he's  a  graduation.  You  told

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:25-0:47:26
 me  he  passed  away.  Did

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:26-0:47:26
 you

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:26-0:47:27
 verify  that?  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:27-0:47:29
 went  to  check...

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:29-0:47:32
 Because  we  were  really  good  friends.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:32-0:47:34
 know  his  sister  would  have  called  me

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:34-0:47:34
 if...

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:34-0:48:09
 Let  me  show  you  what  is  this.  So,  this  is  what  I  got  from  St.  Mary's.  When  I  went  to  St.  Mary's,  Mary's,  you  you  know,  know,  they  they  have  have  the  the  class.  class...  Oh,  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  yeah.  Okay,  Okay.  and  And  so  so  I  I  went  went  through,  through,  and  and  I  I  noticed  that,  you  see,  when  they  gave  me  this  copy,  it  was  already  written  on  their  copy.  Probably  this  copy  goes  back  to  2013.  And  so  then  when  they  got  some  updates,  they  wrote,  and  that's  what  they  wrote.  They  wrote  Gamboni.  Oh,  man.  I  should  have  asked  Mary.  I  think  I'll  call  Mary  tomorrow  and  find  out.  See,  in  the  very  same  way,  I  believe  this  is  your  brother,  is  it  correct?

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:09-0:48:12
 Oh,  Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah,  Jim  died  a  couple  years  ago.

 you

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:14-0:48:18
 how  they,  when  they  hear  about  the  news,  they  update  it.  So  I  think  that's  what  they...  So  who

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:18-0:48:19
 else  do  they  have  on

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:19-0:48:20

It's  impossible  to  forward.  got

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:49-0:52:09
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:49-0:48:54
 you.  So  I  wrote  Bob  Sherwood  at  his  address  in  Nevada  City.  Nevada  City,  that's  But,

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:54-0:52:14
 right.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:54-0:49:02
 you  know,  when  you  get  it  back,  that  doesn't  mean  much.  He  could  have  moved  to  a  different  place,  like  two  years  ago.  There  is  no  forwarding  information  anymore.  anymore.  Or  maybe  well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:01-0:49:03
 Oh,  he  maybe  he  passed  passed  and  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:03-0:49:07
 nobody  nobody  knew  knew  about  about  it.  it.  And  And  the  the  same  same  for,  for,  like,  like,  Don  Don  Stater?  Stater.  Stater's  Stater  is  gone,  gone,  I  I  know.  know.  you  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:07-0:52:27

 He's  been  gone  for  10  or  12  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:11-0:49:12
 okay,

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:11-0:52:31
 Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:12-0:49:14
 so  they  clearly  are  not  updated.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:14-0:49:28
 I  know.  That's  why  it  makes  me  think  about  Gamboni.  Because  he  was  here  last  summer.  Whenever  they  come  through  Sacramento,  him  and  his  wife  call  and  we  go  out  to  lunch.  Okay,

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:28-0:49:30
 so  it  must  have  happened  very  recently.

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:30-0:49:35
 Yeah,  well,  last  summer  they  were  here  and  we  all  went  to  lunch  and  they  do  a  lot  of  traveling.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:36-0:49:40
 Look,  I  mean,  let's  be  clear.  This  is  all  information  that  I  have.  understand.

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:39-0:52:59
 Yeah,  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:40-0:49:43
 Maybe  they  made  a  mistake.  Maybe  they  got  confused  with  somebody  else.  going

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:42-0:53:02
 Well,  I'm

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:43-0:49:54
 to  find  out.  Yeah,  so  just  let's,  I  don't  don  you  know,  these  are  very  important  I  don't  want  you  know  to  call  somebody  and  says  oh  your  brother  is  dead  and  then  it  turns  out  that  it's  alive  and  happily  Yeah,  so  that's  what  I  know.  Here's

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:54-0:49:56
 Bob  Sherwood  here.  I  hear  it  is.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:56-0:49:56

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:34-0:56:36
 Unless  something's  happened

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:36-0:56:38
 between  now  and  then.  I'll  give  it  a

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:38-0:56:42
 try.  There's  the  old  high  school  there.  Yes,  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:42-0:56:52
 found  actually  two  historical  pictures  that  are  really  beautiful.  Oh,  great.  And  also  I  went  to  see.  Actually,  they  kept  it  more  or  less  the  way  it  is.  Well,  exactly.  I  mean,  it's  not  a  high  school  anymore.

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:52-0:56:54
 It's  St.  Agnes,  just  Catholic

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:54-0:57:02
 grammar  school.  They  allowed  me  to  go  inside  to  take  a  look,  but  they  said  the  structure  of  the  building  is  the  same  as  it  was.  Yeah.  And  so  I  got  an  idea  of  what  it  looked  like.  It  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:02-0:57:07
 exactly,  the  outside  is  exactly  the  same,  and  I  didn't  think  they  did  much  remodeling

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:07-0:57:08
 on  the  inside.  I  for

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:08-1:00:28
 asked

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:08-0:57:09
 the  inside.  said,

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:09-1:00:29
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:09-0:57:11
 no,  you  know,  like  maybe  we  change,  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:11-1:00:31
 like

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:11-0:57:14
 shape  and  structure  of  the  inside  is  still  the  same.  Still  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:14-1:00:34
 same.

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:14-0:57:17
 They  painted  it  and  so  on.  But  they  basically,  it's  still  the  same.  it

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:17-1:00:37
 So

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:17-0:57:22
 was  interesting  to  go  and  see  it.  So  anyway.  Ed,  I  had  one  more  question.  OK.  I'll

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:21-1:00:41
 And

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:22-0:57:39
 let  you  free.  And  I  know  that  your  wife  needs  you.  But  the  question  is,  I  know  at  least  for  some  schools,  maybe  St.  Mary's  was  different,  but  I  know  that  from  some  schools,  when  you  join  the  school  as  a  freshman,  there  are  certain  kind  of  like,  how  do  you  call  it,  rituals?  Or  initiation.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:39-0:57:40
 Initiation.

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:40-0:57:41
 Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:41-0:57:43
 In  fact,  there  there  was  was  a  a  picture  picture  in  in  here  here  of  of  that.  that.  Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:42-0:57:44
 Oh,  okay.  okay.  Was  Was  there  there  something  something  like  like  that  that?  Oh,  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:44-1:01:04
 at  St.  Mary's?

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:44-0:57:45
 yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  yeah.  Can  Can  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:45-1:01:05
 you,

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:45-0:57:46
 tell  me  a  bit

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:46-1:01:06
 little

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:46-0:57:49
 about  what  was  the  tradition?  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:49-0:57:57
 here's  what...this  was  a  freshman  coming  in.  During  initiation,  the  seniors  made  them  climb  the  flagpole,  that

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:57-0:57:58
 kind  of  stuff.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:59-0:58:02
 Or  they'd  make  them  do  stupid  things,  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:02-0:58:08
 know,  crawl  or  something  like  that.  So,  but  how  did  it  work?  Like,  first  of  all,  well,  you  had...  Just  for  one  day.  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:08-1:01:28
 It

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:08-0:58:08
 only...

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:08-0:58:09
 Oh,  it  was  only

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:09-0:58:09
 one  day?

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:09-0:58:10
 Oh,  yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:10-0:58:10
 In

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:10-0:58:19
 fact,  it  was  like...  If  I  remember,  just  during  recess  for  one  day,  you  know,  and  they  just  went  through  an  initiation.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:19-0:58:21
 It  was  no  big  deal  like

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:21-0:58:25
 some  of  the  big  public  schools.  You  know,  it  was  not  an  all -day  thing  or  an

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:25-0:58:26
 all -week

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:26-0:58:26
 thing.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:26-0:58:32
 Oh,  because  larger  public  schools  had  a  bigger  tradition?  Like,  for  example,  you  think  like  Stockton  High  or  something?

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:32-0:58:37
 Yeah,  they  might  have.  You  know,  they  would  have  their  own.  I  don't  know  what  they  did  for  initiation  over  there.  Did

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:37-0:58:41
 you  guys  play  sports  against  them?  Oh,  yeah.  We  used

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:41-0:58:42
 to  play  basketball.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:42-0:58:42
 Basketball?

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:42-0:58:46
 Not  football.  They  were  in  a  higher  league.  So  they  were  good

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:46-0:58:47
 at  that?  Oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:47-0:58:47
 yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:47-0:58:52
 Well  they  were  also  much  bigger  than  you.  Like  the  Stockton  High  was  a  much  larger  school.  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:52-1:02:12
 Oh  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:52-0:58:53
 huge,  yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:53-0:58:55
 They  probably  had  a  couple  thousand  kids

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:55-0:58:56
 over  That's

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:56-1:02:16
 there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:56-0:58:58
 what  I  thought  from  what  I've  been  able  to  collect.  Yeah,  they

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:57-0:58:58
 but  had  a  hell  of

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:58-0:58:58
 a

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:58-0:59:36
 football  team.  And  so  great  athletes  come  out  of  there  and  went  on  to  college  and  became  great  athletes  in  college.  We  used  to  play  them  in  basketball,  but  not  football  because  our  basketball  team  was  as  good  as  theirs.  We  never  beat  them  though.  The  two  years  I  remember  playing  them,  they  beat  us  both  years.  But  I'm  trying  to  think.  We  were  seniors.  I  was  on  the  basketball  team.  We  played  Stockton  High  there.  And  we  were  leading  until  about  the  third  quarter.  So  we  had  a  pretty  good  basketball

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:36-0:59:36
 team.

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:36-0:59:39
 Then  they  got  hot  and  wiped  us  out.

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:39-0:59:56
 You  know  how  that  goes.  So,  Ed,  do  you  remember  if,  like,  you  know,  I  go  back  to  my  memories  in  high  school  or  even  earlier.  Right.  And  it  often  happens  in  classrooms  that  you  have,  like,  the  super  cool  kids,  okay?  Oh,  yeah.  They  used  to  call  them

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:56-0:59:58
 the  400s.  It's  called  the

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:58-0:59:59
 400s?  They

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:59-1:00:00
 used  to  call  them,  there's  a  400.

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:00-1:00:03
 There's  400?  Yeah,  and  there  was  a  couple  of  them  in  art  class.  these

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:03-1:03:23
 Okay,

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:03-1:00:06
 are,  I  like  mean,  like  the  top  one?  You  mean  400?  kind

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:06-1:03:26
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:06-1:00:08
 of  snobs.  Snobs,  superstars.  They

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:08-1:00:10
 lived  in  the  exclusive  neighborhoods  and

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:10-1:00:11
 had  plenty

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:11-1:00:12
 of  money.

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:12-1:00:13
 That's  right,  right.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:13-1:00:15
 in  fact,  I'll  point  out  a  couple  of

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:15-1:00:16
 them.  Yeah,  do  you  remember  which  ones?  Yeah,  I  know.  There

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:16-1:00:37
 was  a  two  that  we  used  to  call  400.  I  don't  know  if  Mary  or  Bernice  would  say  that,  because  Maurice  and  Mary  were  good  regular  people.  But  these  gals  used  to  dress  and  they  were...  In  a  fancy  way?  Yeah.  Danty  Walsworth  was

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:37-1:00:38
 one  of  them.  She  was  a

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:38-1:00:38
 400?

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:38-1:00:39
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:39-1:00:40
 well,  we  thought,  a

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:40-1:00:40
 lot

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:40-1:00:56
 of  the  guys  did.  I  don't  really  know  what  the  girls  thought.  All  the  guys  thought  they  were  400.  And  her  buddy,  they  were  inseparable.  Every  time  you  saw  one  you  saw  the  other.  It  was  Barbara  Brisboy,  I  believe  her  name  was.

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:56-1:00:57
 Barbara

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:57-1:01:05
 Brisboy  you  said?  Brisboy.  Barbara  Brisboy.  B,  B,  B.  Where  is  she?

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:06-1:01:12
 Are  you  sure  that  she  was  at  the  same  class?  Maybe  she  was  in  the  class  before  or  after?  No,  no,  she

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:12-1:01:14
 was  in  our  class,

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:14-1:01:14
 but

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:14-1:01:15
 I'm  just  wondering

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:15-1:01:16
 why…  Maybe  she  left?  She  moved

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:16-1:01:21
 to…  Well,  I'm  just  wondering.  Maybe  she  did.  I  don't  remember  her  leaving.  I  know  she

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:49-1:05:09
 was  in  our  junior  thing.  I  thought  I  had  seen  a  couple  of  pictures  of  her  in  there.  See  this  was

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:49-1:02:05
 seniors,,  but  I  guess  maybe  I'm  wrong.  Why  don't  you  ask  Mary  Ann?

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:05-1:02:09
 Okay.  Ask  Mary  Ann  Bernice  tomorrow.  Okay.  Her  name  was  Barbara?

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:09-1:02:10
 Barbara  Brisbois.  Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:10-1:02:13
 Brisbois.  Okay.  Nice  looking  gal.  She's  blonde,

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:13-1:02:20
 beautiful  gal.  You  know,  she  was  always  well  dressed.  You  know,  in

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:20-1:02:21
 fact,

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:21-1:02:29
 her  and  Nancy  used  to  be  probably  two  of  the  best  dressed  girls  in  school  you  know  their  folks  had  a  few  bucks  here  yeah  and

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:29-1:02:46
 so  what  about  the  other  direction  so  where  there  are  people  sometimes  you  know  in  class  you  have  these  people  that  capture  you  know  everybody  makes  fun  of  them  everybody  teases  them  or  like  lots  of  people  tease  them  either  because  they  are  you  know  well  Richard  we  used

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:46-1:02:55
 to  tease  Richard  Huddleston  but  because  we  liked  them  not  because  he  was  goofy  but  everybody  liked  them  and  he  was  always  saying  crazy  things  and  he  was  funny  and  like

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:55-1:02:57
 he  was  a  funny  guy  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:57-1:02:58
 he  actually  was  pretty  funny  remember

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:58-1:03:02
 if  anybody  teased  Richard  Montague  no

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:00-1:03:05
 No,  I  I  don't  don't  think  think  so  so.  Not  nothing  well  to  my  not  to  my  knowledge.  knowledge  you

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:05-1:03:05
 know  It

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:05-1:03:06
 may

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:05-1:03:05
 it

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:05-1:03:08
 may  have  have  happened  but  I  don't  ever  remember  anything  like

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:08-1:03:33
 that.  So  you  interacted  with  him,  like  did  you  have  a  sense  that  Richard,  because  later  in  life  lots  of  people  that,  not  the  people  that  knew  him  well,  but  the  people  that  knew  him  just  superficially,  they  always  labeled  him  as  intimidating.  In  what?  Intimidating.  Oh,  okay.  And  always  wondered  like  how  can  a  man  who  is  like  5 '6",  kind  of  tiny  and  so  on,  but  they  said  intellectually  intimidating.  He  would  talk  to  you  and  you  would  feel  like,  is  he  judging  me?  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:33-1:03:36
 I  could  see  where  that  would  happen  in  college  or  being

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:36-1:03:38
 a  professor.  You  can  imagine  that  based  on  like  the...

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:38-1:03:41
 Yeah,  but  he  wasn't  like  that  in  high  school.  Never  intimidated.

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:41-1:03:42
 Never.

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:42-1:03:46
 He's  just  a  regular  guy.  He's  just  smarter  than  everybody  else.

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:46-1:03:46
 That's  all

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:47-1:03:53
 No,  I  know  he  would  never  intimidate  me  and  I  was  I  was  probably  the  the  worst  student  in  that  class  and

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:53-1:03:54
 he  was  a  smart  But

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:54-1:03:55
 you  felt  comfortable.  Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:55-1:03:55
 yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:55-1:04:00
 Yeah,  he  was  he  was  really  a  nice  guy  really  wise  oh

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:01-1:04:33
 Yeah,  so  I  mean  this  was  really  really  great  because  it  opened  a  beautiful  window  on  this  world.  I  told  you  that  basically  I  know  nothing  about  that  time.  I  know  something  about  his  time  at  Berkeley  because  I've  been  able  to  find  a  few  people  and  I  definitely  know  more  about  his  time  at  UCLA  because  I  know  more  people,  his  students  from  UCLA,  many  of  them  are  still  alive  so  I  was  able  to  interview  them.  There  are  some  images,  some  pictures.  It's  closer  to  my  world,  and  it's  closer  to  our  time.  But,  you  know,  the  Stockton  time  was  completely  a  mystery  until  I  ran  into  you  guys.

SPEAKER_01: 1:04:33-1:04:38
 Well,  there  aren't  many  of  us  left.  I  think  there's,  what,  like  about  20,  did  you  say,  or  22?

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:38-1:04:42
 Yeah,  this  is  the  list  that  I  found.  So  basically  around  20 -something,  yes.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 1:04:42-1:04:42
 well,  and,

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:42-1:04:45
 you  know...  And  then  we  don't  know  for  some  of  them.  And  I  know  Stater's

SPEAKER_01: 1:04:45-1:04:47
 not  here.  I  know  that  for  sure.

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:47-1:04:51
 And  then  I  have  a  couple  of  letters  that  got  back.  So  we  don't  know  what  that  means.  So  if  it  could

SPEAKER_01: 1:04:51-1:05:00
 only  be  like,  I  don't  know,  Don  Perano  just  went,  I  read  where  he  died  last  year.  Yeah,  they  wrote  it  here.

SPEAKER_00: 1:05:00-1:05:00
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 1:05:01-1:05:07
 You  know,  I'll  bet  there  isn't  more  than  15,  15  or  16  of  us  around,  tell  you  the  truth,  I've  known,  you  know.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 1:05:07-1:05:24
 and  in  fact,  actually,  while  I  was  arranging  the  trip  here,  that's  why  I  ended  up  extending  the  trip,  is  because  somebody  was  in  graduate  school  with  Richard,  who  then  became  a  famous  professor  at  Stanford,  his  name  was  Saul  Fefferman,  who  I  contacted  three

default: 1:05:49-1:09:36
 years  ago  when  I  started  this  project  and  supported  the  project  beautifully  and  nicely  with  suggestions.  Excuse  me,  I  think  that's  my  daughter.  Please,  please.  I'll  be  right  back.  I'm  going  to  make  a  Thank  you  for  watching!
