SPEAKER_00: 0:00:00-0:00:04
 Because  this  was  exactly  the  job  that  Richard's  father  had.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:05-0:00:06
 Oh,  really?

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:06-0:00:22
 He  was,  in  fact,  when  he  was  in  Stockton,  until  the  time  they  were  in  Stockton,  then  he  retired.  Remember  that  he  was,  like,  older,  so  by  the  time  you  met  Richard  in  1943,  his  father  was  born  in  1890,  so  he  was  already  53.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:22-0:00:24
 Oh,  so  he  probably  retired  by  then.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:24-0:00:25
 retired

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:24-0:03:44
 He

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:25-0:00:28
 when  they  left  Stockton,  which  was  1948.  In  1948,  he  retired.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:28-0:00:32
 So  he  worked  for  the  telephone  company  until  1948?

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:32-0:00:33
 Yes,  until  1948.  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:33-0:00:36
 hell,  there  it  goes  again.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:36-0:00:36
.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:39-0:00:40
 Let  me  me  go  go

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:40-0:00:41
 get  get  a  a  horse  horse  rag  rig  or  or

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:41-0:01:12
 something.  something.  I  I  don't  don't  understand  understand  why  why  I  I  can't  can't  stop  stop  this  this  thing  thing  from  from  bleeding.  bleeding.  Parts  of  town  so  the  jobs  are  as  close  together  as  they  can  get.  So  we'd  leave  this,  we  would  leave  the  work  center  in  the  morning,  we  reported  at  8  o 'clock  and  probably  left  around  8  15  and  then  we  would  work  until  all  the  orders  were  finished.  You  know,  it  wasn't  just  eight  hours  if  you  had  to  work  till  8  or  9  o 'clock  that  night  you  did,  which  was  good  because  the  overtime  pay  was  good.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:12-0:01:20
 Okay,  so  that's  how  it  worked.  So  actually,  just  to  be  sure  that  I  understand,  so  you  normally  in  the  company  would  start  young  as  a  what's  called  a  line...  A

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:20-0:01:20
 lineman.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:20-0:01:21
 Lineman.

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:21-0:01:23
 Yeah,  you  know  a  guy  who  climbs  telephone  poles.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:24-0:01:26
 Okay,  and  there  you  would  work  as  a  part  of  a  team?

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:26-0:01:28
 Yeah,  you  have  usually  a  five -man  crew.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:28-0:01:29
 You'd  install

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:29-0:01:33
 telephones,  telephone  cables.  Big  jobs.  Big  jobs,

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:33-0:01:33
 huge

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:33-0:01:34
 jobs.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:34-0:01:37
 Then  the  next  step  would  be  to  become  an  installer.  If  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:37-0:01:38
 transfer,  yeah.  That's

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:38-0:01:39
 not

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:39-0:01:40
 necessarily  the  next  step,  it's

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:40-0:01:40
 just

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:40-0:01:41
 a  different  department.  A

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:41-0:01:43
 different  department.  Yeah,  I  mean  you  could

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:43-0:01:46
 stay  a  lineman,  then  you  could  be  promoted  to  a  line  foreman.

default: 0:01:46-0:01:47
 So

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:47-0:01:49
 if  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:49-0:01:53
 want  to  transfer  to  a  different  department  you  just  put  a  transfer  in.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:53-0:01:54
 But

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:54-0:02:08
 I  didn't  put  a  transfer  in,  they  just  came  out  one  morning  and  said  Monday  morning  you're  going  to  go  be  an  installer.  I  wasn't  happy  about  it  because  I  really  liked  the  line  crew.  You  preferred  the  line  crew?  I  did  then  but  after  I  got  to  be  an  installer  I  didn't

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:08-0:02:08
 want

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:08-0:02:17
 to  go  back  to  be  an  alignment  you  know  it  was  more  fun  and  you  were  you  were  out  every  day  to  a  different  job  different  people  different  parts  of  town.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:17-0:02:19
 Were  they  paid  better?  No

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:19-0:02:20
 the  pay  was  the  same.  The

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:20-0:02:20
 pay

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:20-0:02:24
 was  the  same  for  alignment  or  installer.  They  had  certain  grades.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:25-0:02:29
 Which  they  were  based  on  your  seniority?

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:30-0:03:02
 Depending  on  how  long  you  were.  They  had  a  top  grade  for  alignment  and  installer,  the  top  grade  was  the  same.  Every  six  months  to  a  year  you'd  get  a  raise  and  you'd  go  up  one  step.  Like  say  you  started  as  an  E,  you  know,  grade  E,  six  months  be  an  E1,  you  get  a  $10,  $12  raise,  then  the  next  year  you  get  an  E2  and  you  get  another  $10  or  $12.  But  the  top  pay  when  I  started  as  a  lineman  was  making  $36  a  week.  And

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:02-0:03:04
 the  top  pay  for  a  lineman  in

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:04-0:03:08
 1947  was  $66  a  week.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:09-0:03:09
 let

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:09-0:06:29
 So

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:09-0:03:19
 me  do  like  just  to  have  an  idea,  a  year  would  be  $66,  then  you  like  roughly  would  be  around  $3300.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:19-0:03:22
 $33  but  it  took  you  it  took  you  seven  years  to  get  there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:23-0:03:24
 So  you  had  to,

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:24-0:03:27
 you  know,  for  seven  years,  they  give  you  a  slight  pay  until  you  got  66  bucks.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:27-0:03:28
 I  see,  I  see.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:28-0:03:57
 But  that's  when  I  started.  Of  course,  then  we  joined  the  union,  you  know,  and  the  union  negotiated  every  year,  every  two  years,  and,  you  know,  the  pay  went  up  a  little  time.  Every  two  years  or  three  years,  you  threatened  to  go  on  strike,  and  sometimes  we  did.  And  until  they  settled  it  when  you  settled  your  pay  went  up  and  maybe  your  benefits  anyway  and  it  was  the  same  through  all  of  all  the  non -management  jobs  that  there  were  for  the  telephone  company.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:57-0:04:03
 At  that  time  when  you  first  joined  the  company  the  unions  were  not  present  yet  you  said,  is  that  correct?  Well,  they  were  present

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:03-0:04:05
 in  some  groups.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:05-0:04:06
 But  not  as  strongly?

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:07-0:04:10
 Our  group  was  not  yet  organized  with

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:10-0:04:10
 the  union.

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:11-0:04:13
 But  we  did  about  two  years  later.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:13-0:04:16
 And  that's  when  you  were  an  installer?  No,  that's  when  I  was  a  lineman.

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:17-0:04:36
 Then  of  course  when  you  transferred  over  to  install,  you  belonged  to  the  same  union,  nothing  changed.  So  after  nine  years  I  became  an  installer  and  I  was  an  installer  for  six  years.  And  after  six  years  they  said  okay  now  you're  gonna  go  work  in  the  central  office.  I  didn't  transfer  they  just  told  me  you're  going  to  work  up  in  the  central  office.  I  hated  it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:36-0:04:37
 Well

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:37-0:04:40
 I  didn't  like  being  inside  after  you're  an

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:40-0:04:41
 installer  with  your

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:41-0:04:45
 own  rug.  You  could  you  could  eat  lunch  wherever  you  want.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:45-0:04:45
 Anyway,

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:45-0:04:46
 so...

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:46-0:04:51
 Can  I  ask  you,  Ed,  when  you  were  out,  which  area  are  we  talking  about?  Are  we  talking  about  Stockton?

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:51-0:04:51
 Stockton.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:51-0:04:59
 So  how  far  could  you  go  with  your  team?  How  far  could  you  guys  drive?  Because  you  had  an  area,  I  assume.

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:59-0:05:27
 Oh  yeah,  and  out  in  the  country.  each  city  had  its  own  boundaries  like  Stockton  an  installer  would  go  from  Stockton  to  the  8  mile  road  which  is  about  8  miles  no  actually  yeah  8  mile  road  you  do  all  the  installations  from  downtown  Stockton  to  the  8  mile  road  then  Lodi  would  pick  it  up  from  the  eight  mile  on.  And  the  same  way  on  the  other  side  of  town  toward  Tracy  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:27-0:05:29
 so  forth.

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:29-0:06:11
 You  know  they  had  they  called  it  the  Stockton  district.  So  you  could  install  anywhere  in  the  Stockton  district.  So  when  I  was  went  up  to  the  central  office  you  know  that's  where  they  have  all  the  main  equipment,  the  switches,  and  the  ringing  machine,  and  everything.  So  they  send  you,  the  central  office  called  for  a  lot  more  training.  So  I  had  to  go  to  school,  company  school,  for  almost  four  months  before  I  was  able  to  really  work  on  the  switches.  So  I  did  that,  then  I  stayed  in  the  central  office  for  three  years.  And  after  three  years,  believe  it  or  not,  I  was  promoted  to  a  foreman.  So  that's  why  they  kept  moving

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:11-0:06:15
 me.  So  foreman  means  at  that  point  you  were  leading  the  team?

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:15-0:06:18
 You  were  the  boss.  You  were  the  boss  of  a  certain  group.

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:18-0:06:19
 Would  you  go  out  with  that

default: 0:06:19-0:06:19
 team?

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:20-0:06:23
 Well,  if  you  stayed  in  the  central  office.

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:23-0:06:24
 Is  this  hurt  compress?

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:25-0:06:26
 Oh,  excuse  me,

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:26-0:06:27
 let  me  show  her  how  do

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:27-0:09:47
 to

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:27-0:06:27
 it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:27-0:06:35
 Well,  we  were  using  that  for  the  tape.  Now,  what  you  have  to  do  is  put  a  part  of

default: 0:06:35-0:06:35
 the

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:35-0:08:01
 compress  on  every  headband.  And  then  after  30  minutes,  then  you  don't  put  anything  on  for  30  minutes.  And  after  30  minutes,  you  start  all  over  again.  So  it's  not  enough.  And  you're  going  to  take  that.  Okay.  That's  really  good.  Now,  we  go  to  the  other  way.  Good  luck.  On  the  hill.  And  then  let's  do  this.  And  this  will  stay  open.  Okay.  So,  you  know,  when  they  promoted  me,  I  didn't  know  know  it  but  they  were  grooming  me  for  that.  You  know,  because  I  was  a  really  good  lineman  and  a  really  good  installer  and  you  know  I  went  to  night  school  and  studied  electronics  and  you  know  that  type  of  stuff.

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:01-0:08:07
 Yeah  I  want  to  ask  how  did  you  learn  the  job?  Because  you  know  you  left  high  school  without  any  preparation  for  the  job.  it's

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:07-0:11:27
 Well,

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:07-0:08:07
 on  the  job

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:07-0:08:08
 training.

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:08-0:08:08
 just

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:08-0:11:28
 You

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:08-0:08:12
 like,  you  start  joining  the  team,  you  learn  from  your  colleagues  and  you  see  them.  And

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:12-0:09:16
 the  foreman  does,  the  foreman  trains  you  really.  You  know,  he'll  give  you,  you  know,  they  won't  let  you  climb  a  pole  for  about  a  first  year  that  you're  on  the  line  crew,  they  call  you  a  grunt.  So  everybody  else  that  wanted  anything,  hey,  grunt,  go  get  me  this,  go  get  me  this  tool.  And  they  wouldn't  even  let  you  up  a  pole.  You  dug  all  the  holes  to  put  the  poles  in.  Yeah.  But  after  a  year,  then  the  foreman  would  let  you  go  up  just  very  small  short  poles  that  were  not  a  danger  and  of  course  you  went  to  line  school  you  know  where  they  taught  you  how  to  climb  but  even  after  you  came  back  from  line  school  foreman  wouldn't  let  you  climb  for  a  year  and  installer  was  the  same  way  you  rode  with  a  guy  for  about  six  months  and  you  kind  of  picked  that  up  on  the  job.  And  then  when  you  had  installed  pay  phones,  they  would  send  you  to  a  pay  phone  school  for  two  weeks  because  that  was  kind  of  a  specialized  thing.  Yeah,  so  I  was  installed.  And  the  central  office  was  the  same  way.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:16-0:09:17
 Yeah,  you  had  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:17-0:09:53
 school,  and  then  you  went  back  as  a...  They  used  to  call  us  switchmen,  but  the  official  title  was  central  office  equipment  man,  because  you've  worked  on  the  equipment.  So  after  three  years  up  there,  they  called  me  and  said,  okay,  we're  going  to  make  you  a  foreman  of  installation  crew.  See,  I  had  all  this  experience,  and  I  think  that's  why  they  moved  me.  You  know,  they  made  me  a  foreman  of  an  insulation  crew  and  a  central  office  crew.  And  they  didn't  call  me  foreman,  but  they  called  you  a  wire  chief  because

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:53-0:09:53
 you  had

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:53-0:09:54
 both.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:54-0:09:54
 You  had

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:54-0:10:57
 the  central  office  people  working  for  you  and  the  installers.  And  then  I  went  to  work.  I  went  to  work  up  in  the  Mother  Lode  up  in  Sutter  Creek  and  Jackson  area  Okay,  and  I  was  up  there  for  almost  five  years  You  know  then  they  said  okay.  We  were  going  to  transfer  you  back  into  Stockton  Into  they  called  a  plant  service  center  As  a  you're  still  a  foreman,  but  they  call  you  a  chief  deskman  So  that's  where  repair  service  is  located.  That's  where  all  the  service  orders  come  in.  All  the  new  orders  that  the  commercial  people  take  come  in.  They  have  to  be  assigned  a  line  facility.  Then  they  have  to  be  routed  to  certain  areas  and  they  have  to  be  tested  and  so  forth.  So  I  was  in  charge  of  the  test  board  which  had  about  seven  or  eight  testers  on  there  and  you  just  made  sure  that  you  they  were  doing  the  testing  and  keeping  up  with  the  work  and  doing  all  the  scheduling.  You're  really  just  managing  them.

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:57-0:10:59
 So  at  that  point  you  were  more  of  a  manager?

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:59-0:11:02
 Oh  yeah  strictly  manager.  No  no  craft  work  anymore  at

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:02-0:11:02
 all.  Do  think

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:02-0:14:22
 you

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:02-0:11:10
 it  would  be  possible  that  that's  how,  you  know,  what  Montague's  father  was  doing  towards  the  end  of  his  career?  He

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:10-0:11:23
 could  have  been  doing  the  same  thing.  You  know,  they  could  have  moved  him  from  job  to  job  because  that's  what  the  telephone  company  is  famous  for.  You  know,  you're  on  this  job  one  day  and  Monday  morning  say  say,  okay  okay,  pack  pack  up,  up  you're  you're  going  going  down  down  to  to  Sacramento,  Sacramento  you  you  know.  know

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:23-0:11:27
 not  Would  they  help  you  with  the  move?  until

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:27-0:11:45
 about  they  didn't  start  that  to  about  right  right  around  1960  because  when  I  was  promoted  I  was  promoted  in  1965  and  it  included  a  move  it  included  a  pay  move  some  jobs  if  they  were  close  enough  like  if  if  it  was  only  30  or  40  miles,

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:45-0:11:46
 they  would  not

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:46-0:11:58
 pay  you.  If  it  was  over  60  miles,  then  they  would,  you  know,  they  would  give  you  the  expenses,  they'd  call  the  mover,  and  they'd  put  you  up  in  a  motel  until  you're  able  to  rent  or  buy  a  house,  that  type  of  stuff.

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:58-0:11:58
 it

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:58-0:15:18
 So

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:58-0:12:04
 looks  like  the  job  that  you  got,  although  you  started  from  the  very  bottom  and  up

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:04-0:15:24
 went

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:04-0:12:09
 all  the  way  to  the  scale.  But  it  sounds  like  at  that  time  it  was  a  good  job.

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:09-0:12:19
 Absolutely.  Any  job  then  was  a  terrific  job.  You  had  all  the  benefits  and  very  seldom  did  they  ever  fire  anybody.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:19-0:12:22
 So  it  was  a  stable  job  and  it  looks  like  the  salary  was  was  a  a  decent  decent  one.  oh  The  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:22-0:12:23
 salary  salary  was  was  good.  good

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:23-0:12:26
 Especially  because  i  after  like  when  especially

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:26-0:12:27
 after  you  you  made  foreman  the  salary

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:27-0:12:50
 was  good  when  montague's  father  the  last  information  that  i  have  is  from  the  1940  census  okay  so  they  asked  people  what's  your  income  and  so  what  i  see  is  that  he  declared  at  that  time  they  were  still  living  in  south  uh  stockton  you  know  that  right  the  duplex  that  I  told  you  near  Jackson  School.  And  so  he  wrote  $1 ,500  a  year.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:50-0:16:10
 Then

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:50-0:13:03
 compared  with  all  the  other  people  that  were  living  in  the  same  street.  That's  how  the  census  is,  house  after  house.  And  he  was  making  more  than  twice  what  the  other  people  were  making.  Oh,  yeah.  So  it  looks  like...  Well,  once  you're  a  manager,  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:03-0:13:06
 get  pretty  good  pay  and  good

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:06-0:13:09
 benefits.  So  it  was  a  good  job  at  that  level  of  seniority?  It  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:09-0:13:27
 almost  a  guaranteed  job  and  you  never  had  to  worry  about  your  future  and  that's  why  most  of  the  guys  went  to  work  for  the  phone  company  and  then  they  had  this  employee  stock  option  plan  where  you  could  buy  AT &T  stock  you  know  with  no  commission  You  just  buy  it  through  the  company.  It  was  great.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:29-0:13:30
 For  how  long  did  you  work  there?

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:30-0:13:51
 Well,  I  was  a  foreman  from  1965  until,  let's  see,  19...  I  guess  about  1970  I  was  still  working  in  the  plant  service  and  as  repair  service.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:51-0:13:53
 At  that  point  you  had  already  worked  for  them  for  like  23  years.

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:53-0:13:55
 I  worked,  all  total  I  worked  38  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:55-0:13:57
 38  years?  Yeah,  from  when

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:57-0:13:59
 I  went  to  work  to  when  I  retired.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:59-0:14:03
 So  after  38  years  of  service,  wow,  congratulations.  But

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:03-0:14:59
 then  I  was  promoted  a  second  time  into  a  supervising  supervisor,  where  you  had  all  the  foremen  working  for  you.  Yeah,  so  I  was  promoted  in  1970,  I  guess  about  1972,  71.  And  then  I  went  to  work  and  they  sent  me  to  Santa  Cruz  to  run  the  plant  service  and  a  repair  service.  And  then  also  I  moved  outside  and  had  the  repair  crews.  So  the  more  experience  you  get,  what  I  found,  the  more  experience  you  have,  the  better  your  chances  are  of  moving  up.  So  in  1980,  Jacqueline  and  I  got  married.  I  met  her  in  Santa  Cruz,  so  we  got  married.  And  in  1985,  well,  in  about  1982,  they  put  me  on  the  staff,  and  my  office  was  in  San  Francisco.  We  were  living  in  Santa  Cruz  then.  So  I  was  commuting  from  Santa  Cruz  to  San  Francisco.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:59-0:15:01
 How  was  the  commute  at  that  time?

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:01-0:15:25
 It  was  terrible.  That's  why  I  retired  early.  You  know,  it  took  about  two  hours  one  way.  So  in  1985,  they  offered  this  early  retirement.  I'm  not  a  taker.  So  I  retired  from  then.  Then  I  got  a  real  estate  license  and  sold  real  estate  for  two  years  in  Santa  Cruz.  I  hated  being  a  salesman.  So  I  said,  this  job't  for  me  so

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:25-0:15:26
 I  went

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:26-0:15:59
 I  went  to  H &R  Block  and  got  their  training  and  all  their  tax  courses  so  I  started  to  do  income  taxes  from  1987  until  I  retired  about  nine  ten  years  ago  so  I  was  about  I  did  not  I  did  income  taxes  for  seven  years.  And  I  became  an  enrolled  agent,  you  know,  which  is  just  one  step  below  CPA.  And  that  was  really,  I  loved  that  job.  And  the  reason  I  did  it  is  because  I  thought  it  would  keep  my  mind  sharp.  You  had  to  keep  thinking.  And  you  had  to  have  continuing  education  classes

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:59-0:16:01
 every  year.  Learn

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:01-0:16:03
 all  the  new  rules  and  the  new  laws.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:03-0:16:03
 That

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:03-0:16:11
 was  a  very  small  move.  And  I  ended  up  here.  In  1994,  we  moved  from  Santa  Cruz  to  Sacramento.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:11-0:16:15
 Which  was  when  you  started  working  for  the  new  job?  It  was  more  or  less  around  Santa

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:15-0:16:51
 Cruz?  No,  no.  I  was  doing  income  taxes  in  Santa  Cruz.  And  in  1994,  we  moved  down  here,  and  I  just  transferred  to  my  H &R  Block  job  here.  And  then  in  1996,  I  quit  H &R  Block  and  I  went  to  work  for  a  firm  in  Roseville.  Then  I  always  had  my  little  home  office  at  home.  I  had  about  30  of  my  own  clients.,  I  thought  it  was  great  because  I  only  had  to  work  during  tax  season,  you  know,  from  January  the  1st  until  about  April  the  30th,  and  the  rest  of  the  time  was  yours.  It

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:51-0:16:51
 was  great.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:51-0:16:53
 Anyway,  that's  my  life  story.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:54-0:16:59
 Can  I  ask  you,  I'm  curious,  so  you  moved  here  from  Santa  Cruz,  said.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:59-0:20:19
 you

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:59-0:17:02
 Right.  How  did  you  choose  this  area?  Because  you  originally  are  from  Stockton.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:03-0:17:12
 Yeah,  well  when  I  was  in  Stockton,  I  was  transferred  to  work  up  in  the  Motherlode,  and  I  was  also  transferred  to  Sacramento.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:12-0:17:13
 Oh,  I  see.  So

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:13-0:17:44
 I  worked  in  Sacramento  both  as  a  craftsman  and  a  supervisor.  So  I  like  the  area  so  much  down  here  because  it's  so  close  to  the  mountains  and  so  close  to  the  city  and  Santa  Cruz  was  getting  real  busy  and  so  we  just  decided  you  know  the  real  estate  was  going  sky -high  so  we  sold  our  house  in  Santa  Cruz  and  was  able  to  come  down  here  and  pay  cash  for  this  place.  But  you  know  in  1994  it  was  the  bottom  of  the  market.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:44-0:17:45
 So

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:45-0:17:47
 we  really  got  a  good  deal.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:47-0:17:47
 because

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:47-0:21:07
 Is  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:47-0:17:55
 the  Zerr  had  on  developed  yet?  No,  there  was  not  an  energy  crisis  in  1994.  Well,  you  were  still

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:55-0:17:57
 in  a  recession.  That's

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:57-0:17:57
 true.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:57-0:18:18
 Yeah,  you  were  still  in  a  recession,  and  that's  when  the  real  estate  value  hit  rock  bottom,  you  know,  about  1994.  From  then  on  it  just  went  up,  kept  going  up.  In  fact,  it's  still  going  up  today.  You  know,  this  house  is  probably  $700 ,000  now  if  we  ever  decided  to  sell  it.  We  only  paid  like  $300 ,000

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:18-0:18:21
 for  That's

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:18-0:18:36
 it.  one  of  the  reasons  why.  We  got  a  bigger  house.  The  house  we  had  in  Santa  Cruz  was  just  a  typical  three -bedroom,  small  track  house,  about  1 ,300  square  feet.  Here  we've  got  almost  2 ,800  square  feet.  With  a  pool  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:36-0:18:38
 a  hot  tub.  I'm  going  to

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:38-0:18:40
 show  you  the  garden  around  the  other  side  of  the  house.

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:40-0:18:40
 garden,

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:40-0:22:00
 You  have  a

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:40-0:18:40
 too?

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:41-0:18:49
 Oh,  yeah.  I  can  show  you  around  the  other  side  of  the  house.  Wow.  So  that's  about  it.  That's  about  where  my  life  has  been.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:49-0:18:53
 don't  know.  Sounds  like  a  fantastic  life.  It's  not  bad.  Yeah,  not  bad  at  all.  I  figure

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:53-0:18:55
 if  I  can  make  it  three  more  years,  I'll  be  happy.

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:55-0:18:57
 Why  only  three?  You're  doing

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:57-0:18:57
 fantastic.

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:57-0:18:57
 Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:57-0:19:02
 I'm  87.  I  don't  want  to  go  past  90  to  tell  you  the  truth.  Really?

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:02-0:19:04
 Two -oh.  What  hell  can  you  do?  What  you're

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:04-0:22:24
 if

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:04-0:19:04
 doing

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:04-0:19:05
 like  this?

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:05-0:19:05
 Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:05-0:19:12
 I'm  having  some  heart  problems  now,  and  it's  really  slowed  me  down.  I  can't  work  out  in  the  yard  like  I  used  to.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:12-0:19:12
 slows

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:12-0:22:32
 It

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:12-0:19:13
 you  down?

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:13-0:20:21
 I  had  to  have  a  couple  of  stents  put  in.  I  had  to  have  heart  surgery.  And  I  had  this,  what  they  call  an  abnormal  heartbeat.  And  so  I  may  have  to  have  a  second  surgery,  an  open  heart  surgery.  I'm  not  worried  about  you  know  the  way  I  look  at  life  is  when  you're  when  you're  born  the  good  Lord  knows  the  day  you're  gonna  be  born  he  knows  the  day  you're  gonna  die.  So  when  that  day  comes  I'm  gonna  go  it  doesn't  matter  if  you  die  from  a  heart  attack  or  get  hit  by  a  car  or  whether  crossing  the  street  doesn't  matter.  So  I  don't  worry  about  it.  You  know  I  was  was  in  Korea  when  I  was  21.  I  was  drafted  in  1950  and  went  to  Korea  in  51  and  52.  I  was  a  tank  commander  during  the  Korean  War.  And  when  I  got  back  from  there,  I  thought,  hell,  I'm  not  going  to  die  until  my  day  comes.  So,  and  I  had  some  really  close  experiences  there  where  I  should  have  been  dead,  but  I  wasn't.  So  I  figured,  you  know,  I  don't  worry.  My  wife  worries  a  lot,  but  I  thought,  hell,  don't  worry  about  it.  When  the  day  comes,  it's  going  to  come.  Just  do  the  best  you  can  and  enjoy  life.  Every  day  you  wake  up  in  the  morning  is  a  miracle.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:22-0:20:23
 That's

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:23-0:20:24
 about  where  we  are  right  now.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:24-0:20:51
 No,  no,  it's  a  fantastic  achievement.  Do  you  think  that,  because  at  the  beginning  when  we  started  talking  you  were  kind  of  critical  towards  your  choice  of  being,  you  know,  sports  versus  studying.  Do  critical  about  what?  You  were  critical,  you  said,  oh,  I  was  very  much  into  sports,  I  wish  I  had  been  more  into  studies  when  I  was  in  high  school.  But  actually,  do  you  think  that  experience  into  sports  taught  you  something?  Like  in  terms  of  like  I  mean  you  know.  Well

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:51-0:21:26
 it  taught  me  it  taught  me  teamwork  but  it  didn't  teach  me  anything  about  academics.  I  didn't  really  get  serious  about  academics  until  I  was  was  married.  married.  No,  I  I  was  was  married  married  before  before,  so  so  my  my  first  first  wife  wife  and  and  I  I  were  married  in  1954,  and  then  we  separated  in  1970.  But  I  wasn't  really  interested  about  going  back  to  school  until  about  1960.  And  I,  you  know,  I  was  a  lineman,  and  I  thought,  well,  hell,  there's  got  to  be  something  better  than  this.  So  that's  when  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:26-0:21:27
 went  to  my—  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:27-0:21:30
 went  to  Stockton.  They  called  it  Stockton  College.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:30-0:21:31
 Yes,  yes.

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:31-0:21:32
 Before  it  was  Delta  College.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:32-0:21:32
 yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:32-0:24:52
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:32-0:21:32
 yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:33-0:21:38
 So  when  I  was  working  up  in  the  central  office,  I  took  the  night  shift  from  4  to  midnight.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:39-0:21:39
 you

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:39-0:24:59
 So

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:39-0:21:39
 could  go  to  class.  So  could

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:39-0:24:59
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:39-0:21:40
 go  to

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:40-0:21:40
 school  all  day.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:40-0:21:41
 Wow.

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:41-0:21:53
 So  I  went  to  Stockton  College.  I  was  still  going  there  when  they  promoted  me.  So  I  was  still  about  four  units  shy  from  a  Bachelor  of  Arts  degree,  I  guess.  I  never  did  get  it.  But  it's

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:53-0:21:57
 great  that  you  did  it.  Yeah.  Because  it  was  like,  wow.  Yeah.  And

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:57-0:22:27
 then  in  Santa  Cruz,  I  went,  after  I  got  into  taxes,  started  doing  taxes,  in  Santa  Cruz  there's  a  Cabrillo  Junior  College.  And  they  had  these  great  accounting  classes  and  great  computer  classes  and  tax  classes.  So  I  enrolled  in  all  of  those.  And  so  I  picked  up  some  really  good  computer  skills  where  I  was  able  to  do  tax  returns.  And  this  was  in  1982  when  the  Iambem  and  the  Apple  just  came  out.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:27-0:22:29
 So

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:29-0:22:39
 I  learned  how  to  use  the  IBM  computer  when  you  had  to  use  two  floppy  disks,  one  for  the  program  and  one  for  the  startup.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:39-0:22:41
 So  that's

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:41-0:22:41
 when  I  first  used

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:41-0:22:42
 it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:42-0:22:47
 So  now  I  have  have  iMac  and  a  little  portable  PC.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:48-0:22:54
 Like  with  your  laptop  you  have  much  more  power  than  the  entire  computer  system.  Oh  yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:54-0:23:09
 Oh  I  used  to  have,  you  know  you  had  the  big  computer  box  and  if  you  had  16  megabytes,  boy,  you  had  a  lot  of  power.  Then  it  went  up  to  32  and  then

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:09-0:23:10
 64.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:10-0:23:13
 kept  upgrading  and  upgrading,  kept  buying  new  computers.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:14-0:23:19
 When  I  was  growing  up,  it  was  the  time  of,  they  call  it  like  Commodore,  I  think.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:19-0:23:20
 Yeah,  the  old  Commodore

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:20-0:23:21
 computer.  computer.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:21-0:26:41
 The  old  Commodore

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:21-0:23:22
 Yeah,  that  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:22-0:23:22
 one  of  the  first  they

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:22-0:23:24
 made.  That

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:24-0:23:25
 was  a  popular  computer.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:25-0:23:28
 Oh  yeah,  that  introduced  me  to  computing.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:28-0:23:49
 Yeah,  and  then  Apple  came  out.  And  the  last  IBM  I  had  was  when  the  memory  went  to  400,  I  guess  it  was  420  megabytes  or  kilobytes  or  something.  So  I  kept  that  one  and  then  I  started  to  buy  Apple  computers.  That's  why  I  have  an  iMac  now.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:49-0:23:49
 like

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:49-0:27:09
 So  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:49-0:23:50
 Apple?

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:50-0:23:55
 Oh  yeah.  Well  you  don't  have  the  trouble  that  you  do  with  the  IBM.  They  hardly  ever  crash.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:55-0:23:56
 Hardly  ever.  And

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:56-0:23:57
 the  support  is  great.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:57-0:23:57
 is

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:57-0:27:17
 The  support

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:57-0:24:02
 great.  They  have  less  problem  with  viruses.  Yeah.  I  did  get

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:02-0:24:08
 one  virus  on  this  Apple.  But

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:08-0:24:12
 was  it  through  things  like  software?  It  was  malware,  yeah.  It

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:12-0:24:17
 was  somebody  that  tied  up  your  computer  and  then  advertised  and  said,  well,  we  could

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:17-0:24:18
 fix  it  for  you.  we

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:18-0:27:38
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:18-0:24:18
 could  fix  for

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:18-0:27:38
 it

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:18-0:24:18
 you.  Wow.

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:19-0:24:35
 Well,  I  called  Apple  support  and  I  transferred  control  over  to  them.  And  man,  they  straightened  it  right  out.  And  then  they  added  a  malware  program  to  my  computer,  no  charge.  I  haven't  had  a  problem  since.  Let  me  show  you  the  rest  of  that.

default: 0:24:36-0:24:36
 The

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:36-0:24:37
 garden  is...
