SPEAKER_00: 0:00:00-0:00:18
 Sure,  sure,  Ed.  So,  one  thing  that  I  had  in  mind,  Ed,  if  you  don't  mind  repeating  those  two  moments  of  interaction  that  you  had  with  Richard.  In  particular,  I  was  thinking,  you  told  me,  let's  see  if  I  remember  correctly,  one  was  the  story  of  your  parents  were  managing  a  store.  Oh,  yeah.  Remember  correctly?

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:19-0:00:20
 Yeah,  this  was  during  the  war.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:20-0:00:20
 Yeah,  during,  yes.  About

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:20-0:00:22
 1944,  I  guess

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:22-0:00:22
 was.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:22-0:00:37
 it  Yes,  uh -huh.  Yeah,  my  parents  owned  a  little  grocery  store  was  it  in  Stockton  in  Stockton  on  North  Wilson  Way  you  know  a  little  mom -and -pop  store  about  the  size  of  a  7 -eleven  store  is  still  there  but  now  it's  a  liquor  store  I  believe  oh

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:37-0:00:42
 is  it  still  there  yeah  remember  the  address  I'm  curious  since  I'll  be  in  Stockton  maybe  I  can  drive  there

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:42-0:00:54
 yeah  it's  just  a  couple  it's  actually  two  blocks  north  of  Harding  Way  on  Wilson  Way  okay  so  some  Wilson  Way  two  blocks  north  of  Harding  on  the  right  side  Wilson

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:54-0:00:57
 Way  two  blocks  north  and

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:57-0:01:01
 you'll  see  it's  the  only  liquor  store  there  that's  on  the  right  so  it  should

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:01-0:01:02
 be  real

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:02-0:01:42
 easy  to  find  okay  Okay,  thank  you.  No,  so  I  was  saying,  during  the  war,  you  know,  after  school,  I  used  to  go  over  there  and  work  in  the  store.  I  used  to  stock  shells  and  wait  on  customers.  So  I  was  telling  Rich  about  it  one  day,  and  he  said,  well,  man,  do  you  mind  if  I  come  over  with  you  someday  after  school?  I  I  said,  said,  hey,  hey,  no,  no,  that'd  that'd  be  be  great.  great.  So  So  we  we  took  took  a  a  bus  bus  from  from  school  school  and  and  went  went  out  out  to  the  the  store,  store,  you  know,  and  I  was  stocking  shelves  and  old  Rich,  he  was  really  excited  about  it.  So  he  helped  me  stock  the  shelves,  you  know,  and  I  just  showed  him  how  we  did  everything.  I  waited  on  customers  and  Rich  was  standing  there  watching  everything.  Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:42-0:01:42
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:42-0:01:44
 think  he  loved  it.  You  know,

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:44-0:01:44
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:44-0:01:47
 don't  think  he's  ever  had  that  kind  of  experience  before.

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:48-0:01:48
 Yeah.  know,

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:48-0:05:08
 You

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:48-0:01:56
 being  out  like  that.  Very  likely.  Because,  you  know,  he  was  an  only  child,  overprotected,  and  I  don't  think  he  would  have  any  kind  of  like...

SPEAKER_01: 0:01:56-0:02:09
 I  don't  think  he  had  a  social...  You  know,  after  I  talked  to  you,  I  remembered,  when  we  were  in  high  school,  he  never  had  a  girlfriend  or  never  went  out  with  girls  and  never  went  to  any  of  the  school  dances.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:10-0:02:21
 I  want  to  ask  you,  Ed,  so  did  the  school  organize,  like,  dances,  events?  Because  from  some  of  the  pictures  on  the  yearbooks  that  I  saw,  it  looked  like  you  guys  were  going,  like,  sometimes  it  looks  like  you  were  skiing,  maybe,  or  you  were  going  to  school.  Okay,

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:21-0:05:41
 Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:21-0:02:23
 so  can  you  tell  me,  like,  the  very  dance?

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:23-0:02:43
 You  know,  we  would  have  school  dances  three  or  four  times  a  year  and  we'd  have  a  senior  ditch  date  i  think  those  pictures  i  sent  you  yes  were  from  uh  a  senior  ditch  day  and  we  also  had  a  junior  senior  uh  ditch  day  so  the  ones  i  sent  you  i  don't  know  if  they  did  you  any  good.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:43-0:02:46
 Yeah,  yeah,  I  made  some  copies  because  they  gave  me  an  idea  of  like...

SPEAKER_01: 0:02:46-0:03:08
 The  ones  I  gave  you  were,  some  of  them  were  taken  at  Pinecrest  above  Sonora,  which  now  is  a  ski  resort  during  the  winter.  But  they  had  the  lake  there.  And  during  the  summer,  we  used  to,  a  lot  of  the  high  school  guys  used  to  go  up  there.  You

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:08-0:03:10
 guys  drive  there?  How  do  you  go  there?  Yeah,  we

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:10-0:03:15
 used  to  drive.  We  hitchhiked  a  couple  of  times.  A  couple  of  us  hitchhiked,  or  we  drove.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:15-0:03:20
 Can  I  ask  you,  Ed,  how  old  did  you  have  to  be  at  that  time  to  drive?  You  had  to  be  18,  you  had  to  be  16,  do  you  remember?

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:21-0:03:23
 You  had  to  be  16  to  get

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:23-0:03:23
 a  driver's  license.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:24-0:04:05
 Yeah,  so  that's  when  I  got  mine.  I  know  my  brother,  older  brother  taught  me  how  to  drive.  My  folks  had  an  old  29  Buick.  We  used  to  call  it  the  bomber  in  high  school.  It  was  huge.  Anyway,  those  pictures  were  taken  at  Pinecrest,  and  some  of  those  pictures  was  during  junior,  senior  year,  and  they  were  taken  at  Marsh  Creek.  Had  a  little  swimming  pool,  a  little  kind  of  a  resort  area,  and  that  was  near  Walnut  Creek,  just  east  of  Walnut  Creek,  I  don't  know,  15,  20  miles,  but  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:05-0:04:06
 was  an

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:06-0:04:28
 easy  drive  from  Stockton.  So  we  had  school  activities  there.  But  yeah,  we  used  to  get  together,  but  Rich  wasn't  interested.  Couples  used  to  get  together  and  double  day  yeah  yeah  go  out  yeah  we  used  to  rent  motor  scooters  you  know  to

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:28-0:04:34
 go  the  water  like  they're

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:34-0:04:46
 a  lot  different  than  they  were  today  really  well  they  were  just  little  small  motor  scooters  and  it  only  except  two  people  they  wouldn't  go  very  fast  but  it  was  fun  riding  around  town,  you  know?  And  that  type

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:46-0:04:50
 of  thing.  So  in  that  sense,  like,  Richard  wouldn't  participate  with  this  kind  of  activities?

SPEAKER_01: 0:04:50-0:05:08
 No,  I  haven't  seen  Rich,  I  don't  remember  seeing  Rich  at  any  of  the  ditch  days.  And  I  know  I  never  saw  him  at  a  school  dance,  or  I  never  saw  him,  or  even  heard  of  him  going  out  on  a  date  with  girls.  I  think  his  mother  must  have  really  been  sheltering  him,  or  I  don't  know.

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:08-0:05:54
 Yeah,  I  mean,  like,  unfortunately,  you  know,  she  died  a  long  time  ago,  and  she  was  the  youngest  daughter  of  a  large  family,  so  she  was  the  youngest  one  of  the  others  died  earlier.  And  Richard  was  an  only  child,  and  they  had  him  when  they  were  already  old  well  old  like  for  that  time  actually  you  can  tell  me  for  a  couple  so  the  Richards  parents  got  married  relatively  young  but  they  had  him  15  years  after  the  marriage  so  the  mother  was  30  almost  36  and  the  father  was  41  how  common  was  I  mean  these  days  is  not  uncommon  for  a  couple  to  have  a  child  when...  Oh  no,  no,  no.  But  at  that  time  was  it  kind  of  uncommon  for  a  couple  that  had  been  married  for  15  years  to  have  their  first  child  at  that  age?  Do  you  have  sense?

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:54-0:09:14
 a

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:54-0:05:54
 don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:54-0:09:14
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:54-0:05:54
 know.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:05:54-0:05:59
 don't  have  any  idea  to  tell  you  the  truth.  I  know  there  were  seven  kids  in  our  family.

SPEAKER_00: 0:05:59-0:06:01
 Okay,  so...  I  think

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:01-0:06:04
 my  mother  had  them  when  she  started  at  about  18.

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:04-0:06:06
 Okay,  okay,  so  yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:06-0:06:35
 But  I  really  don't  know,  because  I  can't  answer  that  question.  Did  Rich  ever  get  married?  No,  he  didn't.  Oh,  he  never  got  married?  No,  he  never  got  married.  I'm  sorry,  he  was  kind  of  a  loner.  Well,  he  had  friends  at  school,  but  they  were  all  like  myself  and  a  kid.  And  Richard  Huddleston,  there  was  a  picture  of  him  standing  next  to  Rich,  I  believe,  in  the  yearbook.  But  I  think  Richard  Huddleston,  he's  dead  now,  but  I  think  that  he  was  one  of  Rich's  closest  friends.  Oh,  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:06:35-0:06:36
 see.

SPEAKER_01: 0:06:36-0:07:01
 Yeah,  and  I  think  they  used  to  hang  out  together  during  recess.  But  I  don't  know  if  they  ever  went  out  together  or  did  anything  after  school  or  anything  but  we  saw  them  quite  together  quite  often  we  saw  those  two  Richard  Huddleston  and  Richard  Montague  and  uh  I  know  in  the  yearbook  it  there's  a  picture  of  Rich  and  Rich,  Rich  it  it  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:01-0:07:01
 was

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:01-0:07:04
 a  a  group  it  was  a  group  picture,  picture  but  but  I  I  believe  believe  they  they  were  were  standing  standing  next  next  to  to  each  each  other  other.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:04-0:07:14
 I'll  check,  yeah,  if  those  pictures...  Oh,  actually,  yeah,  maybe  you  can  recognize...  I  think  I  remember  the  name  now  that  you  mentioned  it,  because,  you  know,  there  were  so  many  names.

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:14-0:07:14
 Oh,  yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:14-0:07:34
 yeah.  I  think  I  made  a  copy  of...  I  mean,  these  are,  like,  bigger  copies  of  those  pictures,  so  the  quality  is  very  low,  but...  Oh,  right.  So,  let's  see...  Let's  see,  this  Oh,  is...  there's  Rich  there.  That's  Rich.  Yeah,  these  are  all  pictures  with  Richard.  Let's  see.  This  is...  Yeah,  there  he  is.  So  that's  Richard,  and  that's

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:34-0:07:35
 the  other

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:35-0:07:36
 Richard.  This  is  Richard  Huddleston.

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:36-0:07:36
 Oh,  these

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:36-0:10:56
 are

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:36-0:07:36
 the  two  Richards.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:37-0:07:37
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:37-0:07:45
 so  they  stayed  right...  That's  Rich  there,  and  then  there's  there's  Rich  Rich  Huddleston.  Huddleston.  I  I  think  think  they  they  were  were  probably  probably  better  better  friends  friends  than  than  Rich  Rich  was  was  with  with

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:45-0:07:45
 anybody  anybody  else.  else.

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:46-0:07:51
 Boy,  Boy,  these  these  kids,  kids,  there's  actually  too  bad  you  couldn't  take  these  on  a  color  printer  or  something.

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:51-0:07:56
 Well,  the  thing  is  that  they  are,  yeah,  they're  all  black  and  white.  Yeah,  but  I  mean,  the  resolution

SPEAKER_01: 0:07:56-0:07:58
 would  have  been  so  much  sharper.  No,

SPEAKER_00: 0:07:58-0:08:22
 no,  no.  Okay,  so  what  happens  is  this  is  is  actually,  actually,  this  this  is  is  one  one  of  of  the  the  highest  highest  possible  possible  resolutions.  resolutions.  It's  It's  the  the  original  original  picture  picture  that  that  they  they're  are  like,  like,  because  because  remember,  remember,  the  the  original  original  picture  picture  is  is  this  this  size.  Oh,  I  got  you.  You  increased  it.  You  increased  it  to  make  it  easier,  but  what  happens  is  since  the  picture  was  not  that  high  quality  because  it  got  printed  on  a  book,  had  I  had  the  negative,  it  would  have  been  fantastic.  Yeah.  probably

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:22-0:11:42
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:22-0:08:27
 nobody  has  the  negatives  of  those  pictures  these  days.  So  I  just  made  them  bigger,  but...

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:27-0:08:33
 Oh,  I  thought  that  might  have  been  Bill  McFaul  but  I  don't  think  it  is  I  know  you  did  you  talk  to  Bill

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:33-0:08:49
 I  talked  to  him  yeah  by  email  so  he  now  leaves  northern  north  of  the  air  so  he  contacted  me  by  email  and  we  had  a  little  bit  of  a  email  correspond  oh  good  so  because  you  see  this  is  actually  this  is  still  bigger,  but  this  is  closer.  Oh,  yeah,  that's  better.  Yeah,  that  looks  a  little  better.  then

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:49-0:12:09
 And

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:49-0:08:52
 it  gets  a  little  bit,  actually,  your  regional  is  a  little  bit  smaller  than  this.  right.

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:52-0:12:12
 Right,

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:52-0:08:52
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:08:53-0:08:53
 Well,

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:53-0:09:13
 good.  I'm  glad  you  got  all  these  pictures.  Yeah,  so  no,  the  yearbook  was  very  useful.  And,  for  example,  something  interesting,  you  see,  this  is  a  picture  from  the  War  Bond  Committee.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  1944,  1945.  think  What  was,  I  think  was  rich  on  that  one  interestingly  I  mean  they  list  all  the  names  they  don't  list  his  name  I  don't  you  know  I  saw

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:13-0:09:16
 Richard  I  said  I  wonder

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:16-0:09:18
 why  the  name  is  on

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:18-0:09:19
 there  no

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:19-0:09:25
 that's  him  that's  rich  all  right  and  I  one  more  question  for  you  in  case  I  know  it's  hard  to  do  but  I  found  another  picture.  know,

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:25-0:12:45
 You

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:25-0:09:36
 sometimes  the  yearbook  says  these  pictures  at  the  end,  the  last  page.  Oh,  I  didn't  see  that  one.  Do  you  think,  this  could  be  him,  don't  you  think?  Oh,  that  is  him.  I  think  it's  him.  Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  No  doubt.  Oh,  okay,  okay.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:36-0:09:37
 No

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:37-0:09:38
 doubt.  That's  him.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:38-0:09:40
 didn't  realize  that  he  rode  a  bike  to

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:40-0:09:40
 school.  neither.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:40-0:13:00
 Me

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:40-0:09:43
 So  that  picture  was  important.  You  know,  I  didn't

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:43-0:09:45
 see  that.  I  looked  at  all  those  pictures.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:45-0:09:49
 It's  like  one  of  those  pictures  sometimes  in  the  yearbook.  At  the  end  of  the  book.  At  the  of

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:49-0:13:09
 end

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:49-0:09:53
 the  book.  They  had  the  whole  student  body.  Exactly.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Put  it  together.

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:53-0:13:13
 all

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:53-0:09:53
 Well,  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:53-0:09:57
 missed  that.  I'm  sorry  I  missed  that.  Yeah,  that's  a  good,  actually,  that's

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:57-0:09:57
 pretty

SPEAKER_01: 0:09:57-0:13:17
 a

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:57-0:10:03
 good  picture  of  him.  Yeah,  yeah,  I  know.  I  like  it.  So  this  was  either

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:03-0:10:10
 in  46  or  47,  because  those  were  the  yearbook  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:10-0:10:14
 Those  were  the  only  two  yearbooks  I  had.  Ed,  I  forgot  to  mention  another  thing.  found,

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:13-0:13:33
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:14-0:10:18
 when  I  went  to  St.  Mary's,  I  found  the  4344.  That's  where  he  was.  Oh,  so  it

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:18-0:10:21
 wasn't  in  the  yearbook.  No,  this  was  his  first  year  at  St.  Mary's.  So  I  have  two

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:21-0:10:22
 pictures

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:22-0:10:24
 from  his  first  year.  That's

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:24-0:10:24
 why

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:24-0:10:25
 I  didn't  see  it.  Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:25-0:10:28
 you're  right.  Richard  Alston  is  here.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:28-0:10:32
 see,  there's  his  buddy.  So  he's  playing  the  piano.  That's  what  I  was  telling  you.  That  was  the

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:32-0:10:33
 other  story

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:33-0:11:10
 I  was  telling  you  about.  Can  you  tell  me  that  story?  Yeah,  during  assembly,  you  know.  We  used  to  have  assembly  for  the  whole  student  body  once  a  month.  It  was  once  a  month?  Yeah,  once  a  month.  And  we'd  meet  in  the  assembly  room.  They  had  a  big  assembly  room  upstairs  and  Rich  was  the  official  accompanist.  But  he  would  also,  he'd  always  play  this  high  classical  music  kind  of  stuff.  So  I  know  one  day  we  start  razzing  him  about,  hey  don't  you  know  any  boogie  woogie  or  can't  you  play  any  swing?  And  he  turned  around  and  looked  and  man  he  went  back  to  his  piano  and  he  started  to  pop  out  boogie  woogie  and  it  was  really  good  really  by  ear  he  played  everything

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:10-0:11:11
 by  ear

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:11-0:11:14
 yeah  he  was  he  was  a  great  piano  player  yeah  no

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:14-0:11:15
 he  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:11:15-0:11:19
 yeah  i  know  i  know  mary  and  benny  and  those  guys  will  probably  tell  you  the  same  thing  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:19-0:11:24
 yeah  i'm  curious  to  hear  from  them  because  you  you  know,  know  like  like  later  later  on  on,  oh  oh,  you  you're  can  okay.  well  Well,  i'm

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:25-0:15:45
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:25-0:12:29
 wouldn't  be  surprised  if  he  was  beating  out  a  little  swing  music  or  boogie -woogie.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:29-0:12:30
 Probably.

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:31-0:12:33
 There's  Richard  Huddleston

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:33-0:12:35
 again.  They  were  pretty  good

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:45-0:12:45
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:45-0:12:55
 saw  that  in  the  school  annual  or  semi -annual  magazine  a  few  years  ago.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:55-0:12:58
 Do  you  know  if  he  stayed  in  Stockton  or  if  he  moved  away?

SPEAKER_01: 0:12:58-0:13:04
 I  don't  really  know  what  happened  happen  to  to  him  him  at  at  all.  all  i  don't  Maybe  maybe  mary  Mary  or  or  Bernice  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:04-0:13:04

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:04-0:13:07
 benny  or  Benny  might  yeah  know.  but  i  don't  i  don't  know

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:07-0:13:16
 so  can  i  ask  you  going  back  to  when  he  was  playing  the  piano  um  so  it  wasn't  it  was  common  for  when  you  have  the  the  call  the  assembly  yeah  yeah  he

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:16-0:13:23
 was  the  official  in  fact  i  think  in  the  yearbook  he  even  said  he  was  the  official  uh  accompanist  a  accompanist

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:22-0:13:22
 company

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:22-0:13:23
 yes

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:23-0:13:23
 at  i  see

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:23-0:13:24
 the

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:23-0:13:24
 uh

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:24-0:13:31
 at  the  assembly.  uh  So  he  would  all,  you  know,  we'd  sing  songs  and  Rich  would  be  on  the  piano  playing  them.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:32-0:13:33
 Nice.  So

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:33-0:13:36
 that  was  his  job.  So  I  think  Sister  David  asked  him  to  do  it  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:36-0:13:37
 he  did  it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:13:38-0:13:48
 So  yeah,  he  usually  played  played  piano  piano  every  every  time,  time  once  once  a  a  month  month  when  when  we  we  were,  were  you  you  know,  know  had  had  the  the  assembly.  assembly  uh  Because -huh  because  I,  i  we  yeah,  yeah  we  we  always  always  sang  sang  a  a  song  song  or  or  two.  two  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:48-0:14:00
 you  know  later  on  i  mean  like  people  that  um  got  to  know  him  later  in  college  or  when  he  was  a  professor  to  cla  so  what  they  told  me  is  that  he  was  a  very  high  level  organist  oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:00-0:14:01
 yeah  in

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:01-0:14:36
 fact  i  think  in  his  last  year  in  Stockton  and  then  all  his  years  in  Berkeley  when  he  was  a  graduate  student  He  had  a  double  job  He  was  working  as  a  graduate  student  and  then  he  was  hired  every  year  from  a  congregation  Different  like  congregation  in  the  Oakland  area  to  be  the  official  like  organist.  Yeah  the  master  of  music  So  the  organ  is  an  acquired  director.  And  in  fact,  I  think  I  have  a  picture  here  I  lost  actually,  I  don't  know  if  you,  it's  a  very  poor  picture  I  tried  to  blow  it  up,  but  the  quality  of  the  picture  to  begin  with  is  very  poor  But  so  it's  here  it  is.  It's  a  senior.  It  was  from  your  yearbook.  The  senior  choir.

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:37-0:14:39
 Oh,  this  was  taken  in  the  cathedral.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:39-0:14:42
 Right,  that's  what  I  thought.  Right  next  door  to  the  same  area.

SPEAKER_01: 0:14:42-0:14:43
 Yeah.  Do

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:43-0:15:08
 you  think  it's  possible?  I  know  it's  very  good  look,  this  is  Richard?  This  here?  Yeah,  with  the  one  in  the  back.  No,  that  looks  like  a  girl.  Do  you  think  this  one  here?  Oh,  I  can  tell.  Yes,  it's  totally  right,  because  what  I  saw,  I  got  the  transcripts.  St.  Mary's  gave  me  Richard's  transcripts,  and  I  noticed  that  in  his  last  year,  actually  for  the  last  two  years,  he  took  a  class  that  was  That  was  called  chorale

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:09-0:15:09
 Chorale,  which

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:09-0:15:23
 I  assume  that  it's  like  had  to  do  with  the  choir  And  so  and  I  know  that  Richard  was  hired  by  the  Catholic  Church  After  he  graduated  in  1947  for  one  year.  He  was  hired  as  the  organist  and  the  choir  director

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:24-0:15:24
 So

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:24-0:18:44
 So

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:24-0:15:26
 it  it  could  was  what  be.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:25-0:18:45
 you.

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:26-0:15:27
 If  you  look  at

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:27-0:15:36
 it  from  the  back.  Yeah,  it  has  a  small  frame.  Yeah,  but  I  couldn't  say  for  sure.  I  know,  I  know.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:36-0:15:38
 I  remember  the  old  choir,  the  old  senior  choir.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:39-0:15:43
 So  there  was  a  choir  in  the  school  independently  from  the  church?

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:43-0:15:44
 Yeah,  yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:44-0:15:45
 Ah,  okay.

SPEAKER_01: 0:15:45-0:16:17
 Yeah,  they  used  to  have  regular  choir  practices.  During  the  school  year.  During  the  school,  and  then,  you  know,  every  student  at  St.  Mary's  was  required  to  go  to  church.  You  know,  whenever  the  Catholics  went  to  church,  whether  you  were  Catholic  or  not,  you  had  to  attend  the  Mass  or  whatever  was  happening  in  the  church.  And  at  the  Masses,  the  choir  is  the  one  that  used  to  sing.  I  see.  So,  you  know,  I  don't  know  if  Richard,  he  may  even  play,  I  don't  know  if  he  played  the  organ.  So

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:17-0:16:29
 I  know  for  sure  that  from  1947  to  1948,  the  Church  of  the  Annunciation  hired  him  officially.  So  he  was  hired  and  he  was  paid  after  he  graduated.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:29-0:16:33
 Of  course,  the  choir,  the  organ  wasn't  right  here.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:33-0:19:53
 It

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:33-0:16:40
 was  down  above.  Let  me  see  if  I  see  Mary  or  Benny  or  anybody  in  here.  You  could  ask  them  tomorrow.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:40-0:16:44
 Yeah,  I'll  ask  them,  definitely,  because  I  think  they  were  in  the  choir,  I  think.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:47-0:16:50
 Oh,  there's  Paul  DeCarli.  He's  the  guy  that  I  was  telling  you  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:50-0:16:56
 also  a  professor  at  Stanford.  I  tried  to  contact,  actually.  Is  he  still

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:56-0:16:56
 alive?

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:56-0:16:58
 No,  Paul  died  three  years  ago.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:58-0:16:58
 That's  what  I  thought.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:59-0:17:07
 2013.  But  his  wife  and  his  children  are  alive,  so  I  tried  to  contact  his  wife,  but  I  got  the  letter  back.  But  now  I  think  I  found  his  son.  just

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:07-0:20:27
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:07-0:17:17
 wrote  him  yesterday.  His  son  lives  in  San  Francisco.  So  I  explained  what  it  is,  and  maybe  he  may  have  some  material  or  something  we  may  remember.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:18-0:17:20
 Yeah,  I  don't  see  Mary  Phelan  or

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:20-0:17:31
 Bernice  Pratt.  Unfortunately,  the  original  picture  is  a  small  one  and  it's  very  low  quality.  So  I  tried  to  blow  it  up,  but  you  see  the  results.  So  it's  really  hard.  So  I  can't

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:31-0:17:31
 help  you  out  there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:32-0:17:39
 No,  no,  but  there's  been  really  great.  And  I  have  the  same  question  about,  in  general,  like,  from  whatever  you  remember  about  St.  Mary's  and  also,  you  know...  About  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:39-0:17:40
 what?

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:40-0:17:52
 About  St.  Mary's  and  your  experience  there.  So,  which  could  have...  Because  what  I  want  to  do  in  this  chapter,  I  would  like  to  describe  Richard  at  St.  Mary's,  and  therefore  also  St.  Mary's,  what  it  meant  to  be  a  high  school  student  at  St.  Mary's.  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:52-0:21:12
 How

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:52-0:18:02
 the  life  there?  You  know,  like,  how  was  the  atmosphere?  For  example,  one  question  that  I  have  for  you  is  that  I  saw  from  the  yearbooks  that  you  were  heavily  involved  with  sports.  Yeah,  right.  You  were  in  a  variety  of  teams,  you  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:02-0:21:22
 were

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:02-0:18:03
 leader  and  so  on.  In

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:03-0:18:09
 fact,  I  was  inducted  into  the  uh  saint  mary's  uh  athletic  hall  of  fame  uh  oh

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:09-0:18:10
 hey

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:10-0:18:12
 hey  i  think  it  was  2016  congratulations

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:12-0:18:19
 ago  was  it  a  family  tradition  in  your  family  to  be  into  sports  or  you  were  the  sporty  one  well

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:19-0:18:26
 my  brothers  also  played  sports  but  i  was  a  better  athlete  than  them.  You  know,  they  played  basketball.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:26-0:18:28
 saw  some  Baccarat  name.  How  do  you  pronounce  your  last  name?

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:28-0:18:31
 Barakat.  Barakat.  Yeah,  my  brother  Tom  played  basketball.

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:31-0:18:32
 I  saw  Tom,  yes.  And  my

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:32-0:18:33
 brother  Jim  played

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:33-0:18:37
 basketball.  I  saw  Jim,  yes.  I  saw  them.  They  were  in  the  picture.  So,

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:37-0:18:42
 but  I  played.  I  was  serious  about  it.  And  they  just  kind  of  played  it  as

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:42-0:18:42
 a

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:42-0:18:43
 hobby.

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:43-0:18:43
 you

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:43-0:22:03
 So

SPEAKER_00: 0:18:43-0:18:45
 really  liked  it  and  you  put  it  fact

SPEAKER_01: 0:18:45-0:19:01
 in  i  put  in  more  time  more  time  in  sports  than  i  did  in  studying  which  uh  because  i'm  sorry  about  that  now  because  i'm  not  as  smart  as  a  lot  of  other  people  and  i  never  went  to  college  after  you  know  i  don't  think  my  grades  would  let  me  in  anyway  i  was  not  a  a  good  good  student  student.  i  I  hate  hate

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:01-0:19:02
 you  to  say  it.  but  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:02-0:22:22
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:02-0:19:04
 you  loved  loved  sports.  her  sports  yeah  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:04-0:19:14
 i  I  was  was  a  a  good  good  athlete  athlete,  but  but  not  not  a  good  student.  No  but  the  life,  you  know,  the  class,  our  class  had  only  55  kids  in  it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:14-0:19:15
 Oh,  so  it  was  a  small  one.  So

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:15-0:19:20
 yeah,  so  you,  and  in  the  whole  school,  I  bet  there  couldn't  have  been  more  than  300  students.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:20-0:19:21
 Okay,  good.  You  almost

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:21-0:19:25
 knew  everybody  by  name,  you  know,  in  almost  every  class.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:25-0:19:29
 So,  Ed,  can  you  give  me  an  idea?  So  you  said  your  class  was  roughly  55  students.

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:30-0:19:30
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:31-0:19:51
 You  know,  I  went,  I  grew  up  in  Italy,  so  I'm  familiar  with  Italian  school  system,  which  probably  is  different.  So  you  guys  were  55  of  you,  but  how  were  classes  structured?  Like  for  example,  when  there  was  the  history  class  or  all  Latin  or  math  all  you  55  were  divided  into  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:19:51-0:20:03
 no  no  no  people  different  took  different  classes  you  know  so  I  think  the  class  is  probably  probably  didn't  have  more  25  people  in  each  class  but  I  you  see.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:03-0:20:03
 But

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:03-0:20:05
 you  never  never  took  took  all  the  subjects.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:05-0:20:07
 You  could  choose  your  subjects.  When  you  were  a

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:07-0:20:10
 freshman,  you  were  required  to  take  Latin.  You  had  to  take  Latin.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:10-0:20:10
 You  had  to  take  Latin.

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:11-0:20:16
 I  flunked  out  of  Latin.  I  told  you  I'm  not  a  very  good  student.  But  you  had  to

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:16-0:20:17
 take  Latin.  what

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:17-0:23:37
 Well,  look

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:17-0:20:19
 you  got,  so  don't  go,  I  mean.

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:19-0:20:32
 Yeah,  you  had  to  take  Latin,  and  you  had  had  to  to  take  take  English,  English  and  you  and  you  had  had  to  to  take  take  history.  history  and  And  some  some  of  of  the  the  other  other  classes,  classes  like  like  typing  typing,  you  you  didn't  didn't  have  to  take  or  she  you  know  mrs.  LaGoria  I  think  she  might  have  taught  shorthand  so

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:32-0:20:33
 you  ask

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:33-0:20:34
 ask  Mary

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:34-0:20:36
 and  Bernice  I  lost  them  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:36-0:20:44
 well  I  could  the  more  I  got  to  thinking  about  it  I'd  think  well  my  sister's  new  shorthand  the  only  place  they  could  have  learned  it  was  in  high  school  okay

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:44-0:20:47
 yeah  that's  only  where's  to  reach  out  so  probably

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:47-0:20:57
 Legoria  the  only  late  teacher  they're  probably  taught  typing  and  short  but  ask  Mary  and  and  Bernice  tomorrow  okay  when  you  see  him

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:57-0:21:02
 and  and  so  like  there  were  some  required  classes  and  then  you  guys  would  take

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:02-0:21:09
 yeah  and  then  you  took  I  like  the  algebra  and  I  like  mechanical  drawing  you  didn't  have  to  take  mechanical  drawing  but

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:09-0:21:11
 it  was  an  option  there  was  yeah  it

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:11-0:21:25
 was  a  class  I  got  an  a  on  so  no  wonder  I  liked  it  right  I  think  Benny  might  have  taken  it  to  get  it  all  but  mechanical  drawing  get  believe  it  was  mostly  for  boys.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:25-0:21:25
 don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:25-0:21:27
 think  a  lot  of  the  girls  were  interested  in  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:27-0:21:27
 who

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:27-0:24:47
 And

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:27-0:21:29
 was  teaching  mechanical  drawing?  Was  it  still  a  nun?

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:30-0:21:37
 No,  it  was  one  of  the  nuns.  But  I  forget  which  nun  it  was,  I'll  actually  tell  you  the  truth.  Might  have  been  Sister  Jordan.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:38-0:21:38
 it

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:38-0:24:58
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:38-0:21:40
 was  definitely  a  nun?  Oh  yeah,  oh  yeah.  Because

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:40-0:21:44
 the  only  thing  Liguori  taught  was  typing  and  shorthand.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:44-0:21:44
 That's

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:44-0:21:45
 the  only  class  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:45-0:21:55
 had.  What  memories  do  you  have  of  those  teachers,  of  those  nuns?  Were  they  kind  or  more  on  the  severe  side?  No,  no.  None

SPEAKER_01: 0:21:55-0:22:17
 of  them  were.  They  were  all  serious.  I  know  that.  They  were  all  serious.  And  a  couple  of  them  had  a  pretty  good  sense  of  humor.  But  they  never  gave  you  a  hard  time.  Even  if  you  got  out  of  line,  you  went  into  the  principal's  office,  and  Sister  David  would,  of  course,  chew  your  butt  upside  down,  but  she

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:17-0:22:18
 never  threatened

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:18-0:22:40
 anything.  But,  no,  they  they  were  were  all  all  really  really  good  good  nuns,  nuns  and  and  they  they  were  were  good  good  teachers  teachers,  and  and  they  they  really  really  knew  knew  their  their  business  business.  and  I've  never  seen  except  for  the  one  nun  I  told  you  about  that  incident  about  when  I  knocked  the  sister  Gregory's  flower  that  was  the  only  time  I  ever  saw  a  nun  get  mad  okay  and  all  my  four  years  that  was  the  only  time  that  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:40-0:22:44
 were  a  freshman  at  that  yeah  it  was  a  freshman  and  you  were  playing  you  told  me  that  you  were  playing  with  a  friend  of  yours.

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:45-0:22:46
 Yeah,  Eddie  Brennan.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:46-0:22:49
 Ah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  Eddie  Brennan.  Eddie  Brennan.  guys

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:49-0:26:09
 You

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:49-0:22:50
 were  playing  together.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:50-0:22:54
 well,  we  were  in  class.  Class  hadn't  started  yet.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:54-0:22:54
 Okay.

SPEAKER_01: 0:22:54-0:23:19
 And  we  were  just  horse  playing,  you  know,  kind  of  shoving  each  other  around.  Sure.  So  she  had  this  pot  on  the  window  sill,  and  the  window  was  open.  So  Eddie  kind  of  gave  me  a  shove  and  I  went  over  the  window  and  I  knocked  the  pot  off  and  it  fell  down  in  two  stories  and  broke  on  the  cement  and  that's  the  only  time  I  ever  saw  any  nun  really  get  personally  mad  in  fact  she  came  over  and  slapped  my  face  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:19-0:23:24
 know  and  so  do  you  remember  which  of  the  nuns  it  was  sister  Gregory  Gregory.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:24-0:23:25
 hell  I'll  never  forget  her

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:27-0:23:33
 You  I  know  that  it's  a  long  time  ago  and  you  were  very  young  do

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:32-0:26:52
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:33-0:23:38
 you  have  a  sense  of  like  how  old  those  nuns  could  have  been  are  we  talking  about  like  your  parents  age  older  than?

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:39-0:23:40
 Yeah,  they're  probably  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:40-0:23:40
 would  say

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:41-0:23:42
 30s  and  40s.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:42-0:23:43
 so.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:42-0:23:46
 think  I  think  Sister  David  might  have  been  in  her  early  50s.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:47-0:23:47
 Okay.

SPEAKER_01: 0:23:47-0:24:12
 But  I'm  trying  to  think,  was  there  an  old  one  there?  I  think  Sister  Jordan  was  the  oldest  one,  and  she  might  have  been  in  her  late  50s  or  early  60s.  Okay.  All  the  other  nuns  were,  you  know,  I  don't  think  any  of  them  were  in  their  20s,  well  but  I  I  think  think  probably  probably  most  most  of  of  them  them  in  were  in  their  their  30s  30s  and  40s  that's  my  recollection  I  don't  marry  and  the  girls  would  probably  know  more  about  that  than  I  do  you  know  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:12-0:24:22
 I  have  a  question  about  the  same  areas  and  the  people  that  would  go  to  St.  Mary's  so  St.  Mary's  was  yes  it  still  is  a  Catholic  high  school  but  it  was  also  open  to  non  Catholic  oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:22-0:24:29
 yeah  anybody  the  The  only,  it  was  open  to  anybody,  but  whether  you  were  a  Catholic  or  not,  you  had  to  take  the  religion  class.

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:29-0:24:31
 You  had  to  take  it  anyway,  so  there  was  a  religion  class.

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:31-0:24:41
 And  you  had  to  go  to  church  when  the  whole  school  went  to  church.  That  was  the  agreement  when  you  signed  up.  This  kid,  Bob  Sherwood.

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:41-0:24:42
 Uh  huh,  yes.  Bob

SPEAKER_01: 0:24:42-0:25:16
 Sherwood  was  a  very  religious  guy.  And  he  actually,  after  he  got  out  of  college,  he  became  a  Protestant  minister.  You  know,  and  I  think  he's  living  up  in  Grass  Valley  someplace.  And  I  don't  know  if  he's  still  alive  even.  But  anyway,  during  religion  class,  Sister  David  used  to  teach  religion  class.  And  Bob  Sherwood  challenged  her  on  almost  every  one  of  the  Catholic  teachings  and  he  really  he  made  some  pretty  good  points  but  of  course  if  sister  David  countered  and  it  was  fun  to  watch  the  two  go  at  it  you  know  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:16-0:25:22
 so  in  sister  David  would  let  the  student  engage  her  she  wouldn't  stop  him  say  what  you  say  shut  up  don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:23-0:25:43
 no,  no,  no.  They  used  to  have  a  discussion  one -on -one,  you  know.  It  was  none  of  that.  They  could  say  whatever  they  wanted,  you  know,  especially  the  non -Catholics  that  challenged  her.  She'd  listen  to  them,  and  she'd  answer  them  back,  and  they'd  answer  her.  Sherwood,  he  was  famous  for  that.  In  almost  every  religion  class  that  I  had  that  he  was  there,

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:43-0:25:44
 he

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:44-0:25:52
 was  always  in  there,  you  know.  But  we  never  went  to  religion  class  every  day,  you  know,  maybe  once  a  week  or  twice  a  week  or  something  like  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:52-0:25:58
 And  so  do  you  remember  to  have  taken  any  class  with  Richard?

SPEAKER_01: 0:25:58-0:25:59
 Any  what?

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:59-0:26:01
 Have  you  taken  any  class  with  Richard?

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:01-0:26:07
 With  Richard?  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah,  I  think  he  was  in  mechanical  drawing,  and  he  might  have  been  in  algebra  and  some  of  those  classes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:07-0:26:14
 So  do  you  remember  if  he  was  already  brilliant  at  that  point?  Because,  you  know,  later  he  became  a  very  brilliant  student  when  he  was  at...  Oh,  you  mean

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:14-0:26:15
 Richard  Montague?

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:15-0:26:16
 Richard  Montague.  Oh,  yeah,  I  thought  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:16-0:26:17
 were  talking  about  Sherwood.

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:17-0:26:21
 No,  no,  Richard  Montague.  Sorry,  Richard  Montague.  Have  you  taken  any  class  where  there  was  Richard  Montague  in?

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:22-0:26:27
 Yeah,  I  think  I  an  took  algebra  class  with  him  in  geometry.  Was

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:27-0:26:28
 he  good  at  those?  He

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:28-0:26:29
 was  smart.  He

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:29-0:26:32
 was  already  clear  that  he  was  smart.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:32-0:26:50
 think  he  was  probably  one  of  the  smartest  in  our  whole  senior  class.  He  got  straight  A's  and  he  made  that  honor  month  you  know  from  a  freshman  through  our  senior  year  and  you  had  to  get  all  a's  and  some  b's  i  think  to  make  it  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:50-0:26:51
 i  think

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:51-0:26:52
 rich  was  probably  a  straight  a  student  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:52-0:26:56
 i  went  to  check  his  transcripts  there  was  always  always  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:26:56-0:27:06
 that's  what  i  said  i  think  he  was  that's  what  i  remember  about  he's  the  smartest  guy  in  the  school  you  know  and  he  played  the  piano  well  and  uh  the  only  thing  is  he  just  didn't  socialize  much  or  so

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:06-0:27:07
 I  thought  with

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:07-0:27:08
 girls  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:08-0:27:18
 based  on  what  you  remember  so  based  on  my  experience  in  high  school  I  remember  that  there  were  two  kind  of  people  that  you  don't  socialize  they  were  the  people  that  were  like  very  very  shy  you  know  those  are  very  very  shy  and  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:18-0:27:20
 think  rich  might  have  been  shot  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:21-0:27:33
 then  there  are  people  that  just  feel  like  you  know  how  can  you  describe  that  one  says  mmm  you  are  not  good  enough  for  me  okay  you  know  there's  those  people  that  have  that  kind  of  attitude  of  like  well  I'm  way  above  you  so  I  don't  want  nobody

SPEAKER_01: 0:27:33-0:28:28
 ever  had  an  opinion  about  rich  like  I  think  I  think  we  probably  figure  that  well  you  know  probably  really  shy  and  wasn't  interested  in  going  out  with  girls  or  going  to  dances.  But  never  did  anybody  ever  think  that  he  was  different  or  he  was  a  bad  guy  and  you'd  want  to  associate  with  him.  You'd  be  lucky  if  he  would  have  you  as  his  friend  to  tell  you  the  the  truth.  truth  really  He  really  would  would,  yeah  yeah.  I  I  mean  mean,  we  we  got  got  along  along  really  really  good  good.  you  know  like  He  he  wanted  wanted  to  to  go  go  to  at  the  store  yeah  in  algebra  I  think  I  even  had  you  know  I  had  him  help  me  with  algebra  couple  of  times  that  was  smart  was  a  live  and  all  yeah  I  think  Mary  and  Bernice  and  Benny  will  tell  you  the  same  thing  that  They  he  might  might  have  thought  that  he  was  probably  the  smartest  one  in  the  whole  class,  too.  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:28-0:28:40
 was  intrigued  by  what  you  told  me  about  the  day  that  you  guys  went  to  the  store  together.  Oh,  yeah.  I  was  wondering,  one  of  the  tasks  that  you  guys  did  together  was  to  arrange  things  on  shelves?

SPEAKER_01: 0:28:40-0:29:05
 Yeah,  yeah.  Whenever  any  of  the  inventory  was  low  low  you  know  we're  in  the  back  room  and  got  the  like  if  we're  stacking  canned  corn  yes  yes  so  it'll  pop  whatever  it  was  and  we  just  go  in  the  back  room  and  get  the  and  get  the  case  and  bring  it  out  to  the  shelf  and  take  him  out  of  the  case  and  mark  the  price  on  it  and  put  it  on  the  shelf  so  rich  Rich  helped  helped  me  me  take  take  it  it  out  out  of  of  the  the  case  case,  and  i  and  I  said,  said  you  you  mark  marked  the  the  price.  price  your

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:05-0:32:25
 Your

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:05-0:29:11
 handwriting  handwriting  is  better.  So  he  used  to  mark  the  prices  on  the  cans  or  whatever  it  was  we  were  stacking.

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:12-0:29:24
 Because  later  on  in  his  life,  you  see  when  his  mind  develops,  you  see  a  great  fascination  for  everything  that  is  organized  and  systematic.  Oh,  yeah.  Everything  that  has  a  rule.

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:24-0:29:24
 Oh,  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:25-0:29:40
 know  in  his  own  job  and  academic  achievement  but  also  in  other  things  for  example  a  friend  told  me  that  when  they  he  got  married  richard  was  was  at  the  wedding  and  at  a  certain  point  this  friend  of  richard  he  was  very  much  into  scottish  dance  oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:40-0:29:41
 and

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:41-0:29:48
 so  richard  that  was  not  familiar  with  it  and  you  know  scottish  dance  is  one  of  those  dances  that  you  do  in  a  group  using  very  geometric  pattern  all  right

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:48-0:29:49
 okay  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:49-0:30:04
 Richard  got  completely  obsessed  with  it  fascinated  really  learn  the  rules  and  got  himself  engaged  like  he  tried  to  dance  following  the  rule  good  for  him  so  there  is  a  this  fascination  for  like  this  geometric  regular  patterns  and  things  are  each  thing  was  this  in

SPEAKER_01: 0:30:04-0:30:05
 college  or  this

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:05-0:30:21
 was  uh  after  college  after  college  it  was  1969  so  richard  was  38  at  that  point  yeah  he  was  already  a  professor  at  ucla  and  that  the  guy  was  a  young  visiting  professor  that  came  to  ucla  to  to  study  with  richard  during  his  sabbatical

SPEAKER_01: 0:30:21-0:30:22
 right

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:22-0:30:43
 and  so  they  became  very  close  and  actually  UCLA  this  young  professor  also  found  his  new  wife  and  his  first  wife  and  they  got  married  and  Richard  was  invited  at  the  wedding  in  Los  Angeles  oh  and  that's  where  in  both  the  the  the  young  professor  his  name  is  Max  and  both  Max  and  his  wife  were  very  much  into  Scottish  dance  Richard  you  don't  know  about  it  when  when  When

SPEAKER_01: 0:30:43-0:34:03
 they.

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:43-0:31:00
 he  saw  them  dance  and  asked,  how  does  it  work?  Max  explained  to  him  the  rules  and  Richard  was  totally  fascinated.  Memorized  the  pattern,  wanted  to  follow  the  pattern.  Good  for  him.  Yeah,  he  was  very  much  into  it.

SPEAKER_01: 0:31:00-0:31:15
 Well,  I  think  what  I  was  saying,  I  thought  when  we  went  over  to  the  store  after  school,  he  was  really  excited  about  it.  You  know,  he'd  never  done  anything  like  that  before.  And,  man,  he  would  smile,  you  know,  and  he  enjoyed  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:15-0:31:27
 So,  one  thing  I  want  to  ask  you,  since  you  were  very  much  into  sports  and  you  have  an  idea,  and,  you  know,  I  see  that  the  yearbook  spends  quite  a  bit  of  pages  on  sports  and  activities.  How  important  was  sports  at  St.  Mary's  in  those  years?

SPEAKER_01: 0:31:27-0:32:13
 Well,  it  was  pretty  important.  You  know,  we  really  had  a  small  amount  of  students.  And  some  of  the  teams  we  fielded,  like  the  basketball  teams,  were  really  good.  And  when  I  was  there  playing  football,  our  football  teams  were  not  very  good  because  we  never  had  that  many  guys  going  out  for  them.  You  know,  some  of  our  teams,  I  remember  going  to  Doss  Palace,  playing  Doss  Palace,  and  we  only  had  20  guys.  You  know,  we  never  had  the  volume  of  players  or  just  a  lot  of  guys  wanted  to  to  go  go  out  out  and  and  play,  play  and  and  we  and  we  never  never  won  we  never  won  a  a  lot  lot  of  of  games,  games  football  game  now  basketball  was  different  we  had  some  great  basketball  athletes  like  the  the  torso  twins  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:13-0:32:15
 Glenn  I  saw  them  yes  they  were

SPEAKER_01: 0:32:15-0:32:54
 terrific  in  fact  one  of  the  toes  those  made  was  was  inducted  in  the  Hall  of  Fame  the  athletic  Hall  of.  And  so  we  had  championship  basketball  teams.  And  baseball  teams,  we  had  a  pretty  good  team.  Tosos  were  also  outstanding  in  baseball.  We  probably  won  more  games  than  we  lost.  But  I  think  for  the  people  that  participated  in  it,  it  was  important.  You  know,  we  always  get  a  nice  little  write -up  in  the  Stockton  record,  you  know,  about  the  team,  whether  we  won  or  lost.  So  everybody  was,  you  know,  at  least  the  athletes  were  tickled  pink  to  see  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:55-0:33:02
 And  so  was,  first  of  all,  what  was  your  favorite  sport  among  the  various  sports  that  you  played?  football.

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:02-0:36:22
 Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:02-0:33:04
 I  love  football.  You  like  football,  yeah.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:04-0:33:15
 played  football  and  basketball,  and  I  tried  baseball  in  my  freshman  year.  I  didn't  care  for  baseball.  I  only  played  baseball  one  year,  but  I  played  basketball  and  football  for  three  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:15-0:33:25
 So  if  you  were  an  athlete  like  you,  would  St.  Mary's  give  you  fellowships?  Or  you  had  to  pay  the  regular  fees  oh  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:25-0:33:27
 there  was  no  scholarship  not  for  now

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:27-0:33:27
 not

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:27-0:33:29
 for  st.  Mary's  absolutely

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:29-0:33:42
 not  and  so  do  you  remember  because  I'm  trying  to  get  a  sense  of  how  difficult  was  for  a  family  to  send  a  kid  to  st.  Mary's  do  you  remember  if  St.  Mary's  was  expensive  it  was  a  private  school  but  was  it  expensive  or  was  that  well  no

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:42-0:33:46
 actually  there  were  seven  of  us  kids  yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:46-0:33:46
 that

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:46-0:33:59
 went  to  st.  Mary's  High  School  and  when  my  older  sister  and  brother  started  I  think  the  tuition  was  like  three  dollars  a  month  Oh  each  $3

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:59-0:33:59
 okay

SPEAKER_01: 0:33:59-0:34:35
 then  when  my  when  my  other  two  sisters,  no,  in  fact,  I  think  it  was  $2,  because  when  my  other  sisters,  there  was  my  brother  and  myself  and  my  two  sisters,  there  was  four  of  us  in  high  school  at  the  same  time.  Okay.  So  my  mother  went  and  met  with  Monsignor  McGough  and  said,  you  know,  my  parents  didn't  have  a  lot  of  money  in  those  days.  They  said,  well,  we  really  can't  pay  a  lot  of  tuition.  So  he  says,  okay.  He  says,  can  you  pay  $6  a  month  for  all  four?  Okay.  Wow.  So  that's

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:35-0:34:36
 what  they  paid.  They

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:36-0:34:38
 paid  $6  a  month.

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:38-0:34:41
 So  the  regular,  you  thought  it  was  like  $2  or  $3  a  month?

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:41-0:34:44
 Yeah,  when  my  one  one  my  oldest  older  sister  sister  started  started,  it  it  was  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:44-0:34:45
 something  something

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:45-0:34:46
 like  like  that.  that  i  Two  know

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:46-0:34:46
 three.

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:46-0:34:49
 or  I  know  it  it  was  was  it  was  a  lot  less  than  six  dollars  because  that

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:49-0:34:49
 because  that  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:49-0:35:03
 the  total  that  was  a  max  that  they  ever  paid  oh  wow  and  of  course  when  when  my  oldest  brother  graduated  they  never  reduced  the  tuition  it  was  still  six  bucks  you  know  and  all  my  two  sisters  graduated  it  was  still  six  bucks  that  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:03-0:35:29
 fair  yeah  you  know  it's  at  that  point  it  was  the  family  contribution  yeah  so  that  was  I  say  so  that's  that's  a  and  I  so  going  back  to  the  playing  sports  if  if  you  were  a  guy  in  Sam  Mary's  and  you  were  not  playing  sports.  First  of  all,  the  majority  of  guys  at  St.  Mary's  play  sports  or  it  was  just  a  little  group,  an  elite,  and  the  others  were

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:29-0:35:44
 not?  No,  not  the  majority.  Just  the  boys  that  liked  athletics  played  sports.  And  that  was  not  the  majority.  In  fact,  it  was  surely  a  minority.

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:44-0:35:53
 Did  you  guys  also  have  teams,  what  are  called,  like,  the  one,  the  teams  that  don't  compete  with  other  schools,  but  just...  Intramural.  Intramural,  yes.  that's

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:53-0:39:13
 Yeah,  yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:53-0:35:54
 what  I  was  telling  you.  Rich  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:35:54-0:35:56
 on  an  intramural  team  one  year.

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:56-0:36:03
 Uh -huh.  Do  you  remember  what  kind  of  sports  that  could  have  been?  It  was  softball.  Did  Did  you  you  convince  convince  him  him,  or  or  it  it  was  was  just...  just...  No,  No,  no,  I  no,  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:36:03-0:36:22
 don't,  don't,  you  and  you  know  know  what,  what?  I  I  don't  don't  really  really  know  know  why  why  he  he  decided  decided  to  to  play,  play,  but  but  he  he  only  only  played  played  one  one  year.  year.  So  Softball.  we  used  to  play  just  the  other  classes,  you  know,  like  the  seniors  play  the  juniors  and  the  juniors,  the  sophomores  and  so  forth.  And  they  had  a,  every  year  there  was  a  school  championship,  whether

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:22-0:36:23
 it  was  the  seniors  or  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:36:23-0:37:17
 juniors,  you  know,  they  had  a  regular  little,  I  don't  know,  tournament  or  something,  something  set  up  so  you  played  every  other  team  and  whoever  won  the  most,  I  guess,  was  a  school  champ.  So  in  our  junior  year,  we  had  a  terrific  softball  pitcher.  Now,  he  became  pro  after  he  graduated,  made  the  big  time.  And  we  were  juniors  there  and  this  guy's  name  was  Bill  Simone.  And  when  he  pitched,  the  seniors,  they  had  all  the  good  athletes,  the  Tosos  and  Miller  and  Arby.  All  the  good  athletes  were  seniors  when  we  were  juniors.  But  we  had  the  one  pitcher.  So  the  softball  pitcher,  when  we  played  the  seniors,  the  softball  pitcher  didn't  let  him  get  one  hit.  So  we  beat  him  good.  So  we  became,  actually  we  became  intramural  champions  that  year.  Wow.  We  were  juniors.  Juniors.  Yeah.  I  don't  remember,  I  don't  think  we  were  champions  when  we  were  seniors.

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:17-0:37:20
 But  Richard  joined  you  guys  when  he  was  seniors.  I  don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:20-0:37:25
 know,  you  know,  I'm  not  really  sure  what  year  he  played.  It  might  have  been  junior,  senior.  I'm

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:25-0:37:26
 really  not  sure.  But  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:26-0:40:46
 do

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:26-0:37:30
 remember,  were  you  in  the  very  same  team  when  he  played  in  the  softball  team?  Do  you  remember  him  being  in

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:30-0:40:50
 the  team?

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:30-0:37:31
 Well,  yeah,  we

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:31-0:37:38
 had  to  be,  but  I  don't  really  remember  Rich  actually  getting  in  and  playing  a  lot.  I  just  don't  remember.

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:38-0:40:58
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:38-0:37:40
 wish  I  could  answer  that,  but  I  can't

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:40-0:37:45
 recall  that.  Do  you  remember,  was  Richard  kind  of  clumsy  with  his  body?  I  mean,  you  were  not...

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:45-0:37:48
 Well,  he  was  not  athletic.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:48-0:37:48
 okay.  You  know,

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:48-0:38:09
 I  don't  know.  He  was,  I  hate  to  say,  kind  of  moved,  you  know,  like  a  feminine  or  something.  But  not  really.  He's  just  not  athletic.  And  he  never  got,  got,  you  you  know,  know,  I  I  don't  don't  think  think  he  he  ever  ever  did  did  any  any  of  of  the  the  exercises  exercises  that  that  the  the  athletes  athletes  did.  did.  And  I'm  I'm  surprised.  surprised.  I  don't  even  remember  him  riding  his  bike  to  school,  to

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:09-0:38:10
 tell  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:10-0:38:24
 the  truth.  I  don't  know.  I  can't  answer.  I  don't  think  he  was  very  athletic  at  all,  you  know,  for  whatever  reason.  I  don't  think  think  he  he  ever  ever  got  got  involved  involved  in  in  athletics  athletics  except  except  for  for  that,  that,  just  just  that  that  one  one  year.  year.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:24-0:38:25
 And  And

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:25-0:38:29
 he  he  probably  probably  played  played  out  out  in  in  the  the  outfield  outfield  somewhere,  somewhere,  and  and  I  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:29-0:41:49
 don't

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:29-0:38:30
 don't  remember  him

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:30-0:38:30
 getting

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:30-0:38:31
 up  at  bat  or  anything.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:32-0:38:39
 So  one  question  that  has  to  do  with  before  St.  Mary's.  Do  you  remember  which  school  did  you  go  to  before  St.  Mary's?  Well,  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:39-0:38:40
 went  to  a  public  school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:40-0:38:41
 Yeah,  and  do  you  remember  the  name  of  that  public  school?  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:38:41-0:39:01
 yeah,  I  went  to,  it  was  in  Stockton.  It  was  Lincoln  Grammar  School,  1  to  6th  grade.  And  then  I  had  to  go  over  to  Jefferson  School  through  the  7th  and  8th  grades.  So  I  had  to  go  six  years  to  public  school  and  then  two  years  to  public  school.  Then  we

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:01-0:39:01
 went

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:01-0:39:03
 into  St.  Mary's  Catholic  School.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:03-0:39:28
 One  question  that  I  have  for  you  is,  do  you  remember  if  at  that  time  in  Stockton  there  were  because  so  I  got  the  transcripts  and  the  transcripts  of  the  Samaritans  say  the  school  where  you  come  from  like  it  says  where  like  previous  training  it's  under  the  label  previous  training  that  indicates  which  school  the  student  was  coming  from  and  in  the  case  of  Richard  they  wrote  El  Dorado  well

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:28-0:39:30
 that  was  old  rounds  of  public  school  so

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:30-0:39:31
 it  rather  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:31-0:39:31
 a  public  school

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:31-0:39:31
 yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:31-0:39:35
 it's  on  the  corner  of  it's  on  the  corner  of  Harding

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:35-0:39:36
 Way  yes

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:36-0:39:39
 Pacific  Avenue  uh -huh  so  a  public  school  similar

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:39-0:39:40
 to  the  one  you  went  well  no

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:40-0:39:47
 El  Dorado  was  a  eight -year  school  go  there  from  one  first  to  eighth  grade?  Yeah,  because  that's  where  my  daughter  went  when

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:47-0:39:47
 she

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:47-0:39:48
 was  younger.  Okay.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:48-0:39:49
 So,

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:49-0:39:51
 yeah,  that  was  a  full  eight -year  school.  Okay.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:51-0:39:51
 So  he

SPEAKER_01: 0:39:51-0:39:53
 came  from  El  Dorado.  I  didn't  know  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:53-0:40:07
 Well,  actually,  I  think  what  happened  is  that  I  know  for  sure  that  up  to  a  certain  grade,  he  went  to  Jackson  School.  You  know,  Jackson  School  was  a,  I  think  it  was  from  one  to  eighth  grade,  but  it  it  was  was  south.  South  it  It  was  was  in  a  south,  tough  yeah  yeah,  Jackson.  Jackson  because  the  grammar

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:07-0:40:08
 schools  in  South  yes

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:08-0:40:16
 and  the  parents  were  living  there  in  Montague  Richard  lived  there  with  the  parents  until  until  he  was  10  or  11  oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:16-0:40:17
 okay  then

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:17-0:40:21
 they  moved  very  close  to  San  Mary's  but  that  was  before  was  like  that  was  on  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:21-0:40:22
 other  out  of  school  this  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:22-0:40:42
 they're  all  right  now  it  makes  sense  why.  So  probably  he  went  for  like  four  or  five  grades.  He  went  to  Jackson.  Sorry,  what's  it  called?  Yes,  Jackson  School,  when  they  were  living  there.  Right.  Then  the  family,  I  think,  became  a  little  bit  wealthier,  was  able  to  buy  a,  I  guess,  you  know,  the  neighborhood  got  better  because  it's  close  to  St.  Mary's.  Oh,  yeah.  El

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:42-0:40:45
 Dorado  School  is  a  good  neighborhood.  They  have  some  nicer  homes  out

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:45-0:40:50
 there.  In  fact,  they  got  a  home.  And  so  they  used  to  live  in  a...  What's  it  called?  A  duplex?

SPEAKER_01: 0:40:50-0:40:52
 Yeah,  you  know  what  street  that  was  on?

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:52-0:41:17
 Yes.  Let  me  see.  I  have  the  map  in  my  mind.  It's  two  blocks  from  Jackson.  From  where  Jackson  School  used  to  be.  be  oh  and  you  mean  a  South  Stockton  when  they  lived  out  yeah  you  know  that  the  one  the  house  where  they  end  up  going  is  there  was  right  next  to  the  Church  of  the  Annunciation  is  on  a  street  called  van  van  Buren  oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:17-0:41:17
 yeah  Van  Buren

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:17-0:41:35
 it's  like  I  went  to  see  it  you  know  and  now  Van  Buren  there's  the  square  in  front  of  the  Church  of  the  Annunciation,  and  they  build  that  medical  facility.  And  so  the  house  used  to  be  where  now  there  is  one  of  the  medical  facilities.  There  is  a  part  of  Van  Buren...  Well,  now,

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:35-0:41:43
 wait,  now.  I  don't  think  we're  talking  about  the  cathedral  of  the  Annunciation.  I  don't  think  there's  a  medical  facility  across  the  street  from  that.

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:43-0:41:47
 There  is,  okay.  If  you  are  at  the  entrance  of  the  church,

SPEAKER_01: 0:41:47-0:41:48
 there

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:48-0:42:20
 is  one  on  the  right.  Oh,  okay.  Because  on  the  right  there  is  a  big  medical  facility.  Over  on  that  side.  And  if  you  cross  the  square,  on  the  other  side,  there  is  something  like  medical  offices.  Right.  Okay,  I  thought  you  were  talking  directly  across  the  street  from  the  main  entrance.  No,  no,  no.  So  if  you  cross  the  square,  there  are  these  medical  offices  that  are  right  on  the  corner.  And  I  think  there  were  at  least  two  or  three  homes  there.  And  I  think  the  Montague's  home  was,  if  not  the  last  one,  the  one  before  the  last  one.  So  the  house  got  destroyed.  But  the  neighborhood  was  the  neighborhood,  which  was  definitely  better  than  the  previous  neighborhood.  Yeah,  they

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:20-0:42:27
 had  some  nice  houses.  Of  course,  in  those  days,  during  the  40s,  those  were  really  nice  houses.

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:27-0:42:34
 So  where  did  your  family  live  at  that  time?  When  you  were  going  to  the  Annunciation,  sorry,  to  St.  Mary's?  Well,  we  lived

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:34-0:42:59
 on  East  Main  Street  in  Stockton,  which  isn't  even  close  to  St.  Mary's.  We  had  to  take  a  bus  and  and  transfer  transfer  once.  once.  So  we  lived  on  in  the  1400  block  on  East  Main  just  a  block  off  of  Wilson  Way.  You  know  and  I'm  telling  you  about  my  parents  market.  Yeah.  Well  Wilson  Way  was  one  block  from  where  we  lived.  Oh.

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:59-0:43:00
 But  if  you  go  north

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:00-0:43:08
 about  a  mile  and  a  half  or  maybe  two  miles  that's  where  the  store  was  because  it  was  I  think  it  was  like  in  the  seventeen  or  eighteen  hundred  block

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:09-0:43:09
 I'm  not

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:09-0:43:13
 sure  but  it's  two  blocks  north  of  Harding  Way  so

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:13-0:43:17
 you  when  you  when  you  guys  were  going  to  school  you  would  take  the  bus  which

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:17-0:43:19
 I  could  both  oh  yeah  we  could  take  a  bus  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:19-0:43:23
 there  anybody  that  was  going  to  school  by  car  well

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:23-0:43:25
 well  in  high  school  there  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:25-0:43:25
 yes  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:43:25-0:43:38
 there  was  Charlie  Rizzo  was  and  one  of  the  Wallace's  I  forget  which  one  in  fact  in  fact  there  was  a  there  was  a  there  was  a  picture  in  the  yearbook  of  a  couple  of  cars  that  were  parked  next  to  the  school  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:38-0:43:41
 was  wondering  yes  so  those  are  there  could  have  been

default: 0:44:07-0:44:08
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:08-0:44:15
 know  Charlie  Rizzo  had  his  own  car.  cars.  You  want  me  to  go  get  those?  Yeah,  sure,  sure,  sure.  I'll  show  you  which  one's  a  war.  Their  parents  owned  a  real  nice  restaurant,  so  they  were  considered  really

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:15-0:44:29
 wealthy.  Initially,  Ed,  about  being  wealthy,  do  you  have  a  sense  that  of  the  people  that  were  at  St.  Mary's,  as  far  as  the  economic  status  was  concerned,  was  there  variation?

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:29-0:44:37
 Yeah,  most  of  them.  Actually,  most  were  just  low  income.  And  then  there  were  some  pretty  well -off  people.  And  then  there  was  a  lot  of  middle  class.

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:37-0:44:39
 Middle  class,  okay.  It  was  really  a  mix.

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:39-0:44:48
 Okay.  Now,  this  Jeep  in  here  belonged  to  a  guy  named  Peter  Maringo.  Oh,  a  student?  Yeah,  he  was  a  student.  Okay,  fancy

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:48-0:44:48

SPEAKER_01: 0:44:48-0:44:58
 So  he  had  the  car.  That's  another  car,  clearly.  Yeah,  I  don't...  Well,  that  was  Elodie  Russell.

 was  her  parents'  car.  That's  Elodie  Russell.  Okay,  okay.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:02-0:45:02
 And  that's

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:02-0:45:08

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:08-0:45:10
 I'm  going  to  have  to  tomorrow.

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:11-0:45:20

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:20-0:45:20

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:39-0:45:47
 gals.  Actually,  Ed,  can  I  ask  you  about  driving?  Was  it  common  in  those  days  for  a  woman  to  drive,  or  it  was  mainly  a  man  activity?

SPEAKER_01: 0:45:47-0:45:48

 if...

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:55-0:50:40
 Let  me  show  you  what  it's  based  on.  So,  this  is  what  I  got  from  St.  Mary's.  When  I  went  to  St.  Mary's,  you  know,  they  have  the  class.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  Okay.  And  so  I  went  through,  and  I  noticed  that,  you  see,  when  they  gave  me  this  copy,  it  was  already  written  on  their  copy.  Probably  this  copy  goes  back  to  2013.  And  so,  well,  then  when  they  got  some  updates,  they  wrote,  and  that's  what  they  wrote.  They  wrote  Gamboni.  Man,  I've

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:20-0:47:23
 got  to  ask  Marion.  I  think  I'll  call  Marion  tomorrow  and  find  out.

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:25-0:47:30
 See,  in  the  very  same  way,  I  believe  this  is  your  brother,  is  it  correct?

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:30-0:47:33
 Oh,  Jim.  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah,  but  Jim  died  a  couple  of  years  ago.

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:33-0:47:39
 Yeah,  so  three  years  ago.  So  you  see  how  they,  when  they  hear  about  the  news,  they  update  it.  So  I  think  that's  what  they...  else

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:39-0:50:59
 So  who

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:39-0:47:40
 do  they  have  on  there  that's  in

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:40-0:47:41
 our  class?

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:42-0:47:47
 May,  like...  Oh,  Don  Perano.  Don  Perano.  perrano  don  Yeah  died  here  last

SPEAKER_01: 0:47:47-0:47:48
 year  the  year  before

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:48-0:48:15
 and  then  deacon  no  so  this  is  the  next  class  that's  there  so  yeah  they  they  they're  your  class  it's  don  gamboni  and  then  uh  don  perrano  yeah  that's  that's  the  only  one  that  were  marked  one  thing  that  will  you  see  the  wonder  where  you  you  see  see  the  pencil  is  I  sent  them  letters  at  the  address  that  is  here,  and  I  got  it  back.  It  says  impossible  to  forward.  I  got  you.  So  I  wrote  Bob  Sherwood  at  his  address  in  Nevada  City.  Nevada  City,  that's

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:15-0:51:35
 right.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:15-0:48:23
 But,  you  know,  when  you  get  it  back,  that  doesn't  mean  much.  He  could  have  moved  to  a  different  place  like  two  years  ago.  There  is  no  forwarding  information  anymore.  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:23-0:48:24
 maybe  he  passed  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:24-0:48:26
 nobody  knew  about  it.  And  the  same  for  like  Don  Stater.

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:27-0:48:27
 Stater's  gone,

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:27-0:48:28
 I

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:28-0:48:28
 know.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:28-0:48:29
 Oh,  you  know  that.  Oh,

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:29-0:48:32
 yeah.  He's  been  gone  for  10  or  12  years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:32-0:48:34
 Oh,  okay,  so  they  clearly  have  not  updated.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:34-0:48:35
 no,

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:35-0:48:35
 no.

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:35-0:48:49
 That's  why  it  makes  me  think  about  Gamboni.  Because  he  was,  this  last  is  Gamboni  summer.  here.  He  was  here  Whenever  they  come  through  Sacramento,  him  and  his  wife  call  and  we  go  out  to  lunch.  Okay,

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:49-0:48:51
 so  it  must  have  happened  very  recently.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:51-0:48:55
 well,  last  summer  they  were  here  and  we  all  went  to  lunch.  They

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:55-0:48:56
 do  a  lot  of

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:56-0:48:56
 traveling.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:56-0:48:57
 Look,  mean,

SPEAKER_01: 0:48:57-0:52:17
 I

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:57-0:49:15
 let's  be  clear.  This  is  all  information  that  I  have.  Maybe  they  made  a  mistake.  Maybe  they  got  confused  with  somebody  else.  I'm  going  to  find  out.  Yeah,  yeah.  So  just  let's,  like  I  I  don't  you  know  these  are  very  important  I  don't  want  you  know  to  call  somebody  and  says  oh  your  brother  is  dead  and  then  it  turns  out  that  it's  slowly  alive  and  happily  alive  so  that's  what  I  know  always

SPEAKER_01: 0:49:15-0:49:16
 Bob  Sherwood  here  I

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:35-0:50:36
 so  I  had  a  lot

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:36-0:50:36
 was  gone

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:36-0:50:42
 and  and  so  at  um  it  looks  like  the  most  of  the  students  were  white  in  the  school  oh  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:42-0:50:45
 all  except  all  except  for  George  Miller.  Okay.  But  there  were  a

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:45-0:50:48
 lot  of  Hispanics.  There  were  Hispanics?  Oh,  yeah.  In

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:48-0:50:49
 fact,  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:49-0:50:49
 know,

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:49-0:50:51
 Hispanics  are  mostly  Catholic.

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:52-0:50:53
 Yeah,  that's  true.

SPEAKER_01: 0:50:53-0:50:58
 And  a  lot  of  Hispanics  and  Italians  sent  their  kids  to  St.  Mary's,

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:59-0:51:00
 you  know,  because  they  were  good  Catholics.  Sure,  sure.

SPEAKER_01: 0:51:01-0:51:03
 So  you'll  see  a  lot  of  Hispanics.

SPEAKER_00: 0:51:04-0:51:12
 But  there  were  no  Asians.  I  have  not  seen  Asians.  There  were  no  Asian  students.  At  least  I  didn't  see  from  looking  at  it.  No,  I  don't  remember.  I

SPEAKER_01: 0:51:12-0:51:15
 don't  remember  when  I  actually  tell  you  the  truth.

SPEAKER_00: 0:51:18-0:51:23
 Because  I  went  through  all  the  yearbooks  to  see,  you  know,  who  graduated,  to  look  at  them.  You  know,  sometimes  it's  hard  to  see,  sometimes

SPEAKER_01: 0:51:23-0:51:34

SPEAKER_00: 0:51:45-0:51:46
 Can  I  ask  you,  what's  a

SPEAKER_01: 0:51:46-0:52:04
 sergeant  at  arms?  Pardon  me?  What's  a  sergeant  at  arms?  Well,  actually,  it's  just  a  title.  In  a  senior  class,  when  you're  having  a  class  meeting,  if  anybody  got  rowdy,  Sergeant  LaVar  is  supposed  to  take  them  out  and  kick  them  out.

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:05-0:52:06
 Tiny  little  Richard?  Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: 0:52:06-0:52:13
 So  for  Richard  it  was  mostly  honorary.  In  fact,  almost  in  every  class  a  Sergeant  of  Arms  really  just

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:13-0:52:19
 a  title.  You  had  to  have  one.  Yeah,  okay.  So  you  had  to  choose  one  and  somebody  had  to  be  one.

SPEAKER_01: 0:52:40-0:52:40
 Josephine  yeah

 Bernie's

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:44-0:52:55
 yes  Bernie  yeah  it's  a  little  bit  tricky  here  because  of  for  women  there  they  appear  with  Oh,  let's  see.  You  said  Alice  Lopez?  Didn't  you  say  it  was  Alice  Messini  now,  I  believe?  Is  that  the  one  you  said  you  called  or  had  her  telephone  number  or  something?  their  maiden  name  well  here  they  appear  so  sometimes  I  need  to  cry  so  the  one  that  I  talk  on  the  phone  was  and

 yeah  i  do  you  get  i  get  a  christmas  card  from  him  every  year  okay

SPEAKER_00: 0:55:53-0:56:00
 okay  and  i  got  one  last  last  question  okay  unless  something's  happening  between  now  and  then  okay  no  i'll  give  it  a  try  yeah  and

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:00-0:56:02
 there's  your  high  school  there  yes  yes

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:02-0:56:13
 i  i  found  actually  two  historical  pictures  that  are  really  beautiful.  And  also  I  went  to  see,  actually  they  kept  it  more  or  less  the  way  it  is.  Well,  exactly.  I  mean  it's  not  a  high  school  anymore.  I...

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:13-0:59:33
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:13-0:56:15
 It's  St.  Agnes  Catholic  Grammar  School.  They

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:15-0:59:35
 Yeah,  yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:15-0:56:20
 allowed  me  to  go  inside  to  take  a  look.  But  they  said,  you  know,  the  structure  of  the  building  is  the  same  as  it  was.

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:20-0:56:20
 And

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:20-0:56:23
 so  I  got  an  idea  of  what  it  looked  like.  It  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:23-0:56:28
 exactly,  the  outside  is  exactly  the  same  and  I  Didn't  think  they  did  much.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:28-0:56:39
 I  Asked  for  the  inside  said  no  You  know  like  we  maybe  we  change  like  the  shape  and  the  structure  of  the  inside  is  still  the  same  But  they  basically  still  the  same  so  it  was  interesting  to  go  and  see  it

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:40-0:56:41
 So  anyway,  and

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:41-0:56:45
 I  had  one  more  question  and  I  let  you  free  and  I  know  that  your  wife  needs  you.  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:56:44-1:00:04
 But

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:45-0:57:00
 question  is,  I  know  at  least  for  some  schools,  maybe  St.  Mary's  was  different,  but  I  know  that  from  some  schools  when  you  join  the  school  as  a  freshman,  there  are  certain  kind  of  like,  how  do  you  call,  like  rituals  that  the  most...  initiation.

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:00-1:00:20
 Oh,

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:00-0:57:01
 Initiation,  yes.  yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:01-1:00:21
 Yeah,

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:01-0:57:06
 yeah.  In  fact,  there  was  a  picture  in  here  of  that.  Oh,  okay.  Was  there  something  like  that  in  at  St.  the  seminaries?  Mary's?

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:06-1:00:26
 Yeah

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:06-0:57:07
 Can  you  tell  me  a  bit

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:07-1:00:27
 little

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:07-0:57:08
 about  what  was  the  tradition?

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:08-0:57:18
 Well,  this  was  a  freshman  coming  in.  During  initiation,  the  seniors  made  them  climb  the  flagpole.  That

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:18-0:57:18
 kind

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:18-0:57:23
 of  stuff.  Or  you  know  or  they  they'd  make  make  them  them  do  do  stupid  stupid  things.  things  like  Yes,  that's

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:23-0:57:31
 that  tradition.  pretty  sure  all  something  like  that  so  but  how  did  he  work  like  first  of  all  well  you  had  for  one  day  it  was  all  it  was  only  one  day  oh  yeah  in  fact

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:31-0:57:37
 it  was  like  if  I  remember  just  during  recess  for  one  day  you

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:37-0:57:37
 know

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:37-0:57:40
 and  they  just  went  through  an  initiation  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:40-0:57:41
 was  no  big  deal

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:41-0:57:46
 like  that's  it  some  of  the  big  public  schools  you  know  it  was  not  an  all -day  thing  or

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:46-0:57:46
 an  all -week

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:46-0:57:47
 thing.

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:47-0:57:53
 Oh,  because  larger  public  schools  had  a  bigger  tradition?  Like,  for  example,  you're  thinking  like  Stockton  High  or  something?  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:57:53-0:57:57
 they  might  have.  They  would  have  their  own.  I  don't  know  what  they  did  for  initiation  over  there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:57:57-0:58:03
 Did  you  guys  play  sports  against  them?  Oh  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  we  We  played  played  basketball.  basketball.  Not  Basketball?

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:03-0:58:06
 Not  football,  football.  they  They  were  were  in  in  a  a  higher  higher  league.  league.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:06-0:58:07
 So  So  they  they  were  were  good  good  at  at  that?  that?  Oh

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:07-0:58:08
 yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:08-0:58:13
 Well  they  were  also  much  bigger  than  you,  like  the  Stockton  High  was  a  much  larger  school.  was

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:13-1:01:33
 Oh  it

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:13-0:58:15
 huge,  yeah.  They

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:15-0:58:16
 probably  had  a  couple  thousand

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:16-0:58:16
 kids  That's

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:16-1:01:36
 over  there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:16-0:58:18
 what  I  thought  from  what  I've  been  able  to  collect.  Yeah,

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:18-1:01:38
 but

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:18-0:58:19
 they  had  a  hell

SPEAKER_01: 0:58:19-0:58:59
 of  a  football  team  and  so  great  athletes  come  out  of  there  and  went  on  to  college  and  became  great  athletes  in  college.  We  used  to  play  them  in  basketball,  but  not  football,  because  our  basketball  team  was  as  good  as  theirs.  We  never  beat  them,  though.  The  two  years  I  remember  playing  them,  they  beat  us  both  years.  But  I'm  trying  to  think.  When  we  were  seniors,  I  was  on  the  basketball  team.  We  played  stop  and  high  there.  And  we  were  leading  until  about  the  third  quarter.  So  we  had  a  pretty  good  basketball  team.  Then  they  got  hot  and  wiped  us  out.

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:00-0:59:17
 Well.  Still  you  did  well.  Yeah.  And  so,  Ed,  do  you  remember  if,  like,  you  know,  I  go  back  to  my  memories  in  high  school  or  even  earlier.  Right.  And  it  often  happens  in  classrooms  that  you  have,  like,  the  super  cool  kids,  okay?  Oh,  yeah.  They  used  to

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:17-0:59:17
 call

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:17-0:59:17
 them  the

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:17-0:59:18
 400s.  It's  called

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:18-0:59:18

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:18-0:59:19
 400s?

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:19-0:59:20
 Yeah,  you

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:20-0:59:22

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:22-0:59:25
 a  400?  Yeah,  and  there  was  a  couple  of  them  in  art  class.  Okay,  These  these  are  are,  the  I  top

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:24-1:02:44

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:25-0:59:27

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:27-0:59:31

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:31-0:59:31
 Had

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:31-0:59:35
 plenty  of  money.  In  fact,  I'll  point  out  a  couple  of

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:35-0:59:36
 them.

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:36-0:59:58
 Do  you  remember  which  one?  There  was  a  two  that  we  used  to  call  400.  I  don't  know  if  Barry  or  Bernice  would  say  that,  because  Mary  and  Mary  were  good  regular  people,  but  these  gals  used  to  dress…  In  a  fancy  way?  Yeah.  Nancy  Walsworth  was

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:58-0:59:58
 one

SPEAKER_01: 0:59:58-1:00:01
 of  them.  She  was  a  400?  Well,  we  thought…  A

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:01-1:00:01
 lot  of  the

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:01-1:00:02
 guys  did.

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:02-1:00:02
 I

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:02-1:00:03
 don't  really  know  what  the  girls

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:03-1:00:04
 thought.

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:04-1:00:28
 All  the  guys  thought  they  were  400.  And  her  buddy,  they  were  inseparable.  Every  time  you  saw  one,  you  saw  the  other.  It  was  Barbara  Brisboy,  I  believe  her  name  was.  Barbara  Brisboy,  Barbara  Brisboy.  B -B -B.  Where  is  she?  Are

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:28-1:00:33
 you  sure  she  was  in  the  same  class?  Maybe  she  was  in  the  class  before  or  after?  No,  no,

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:33-1:00:35
 she  was  in  our  class.

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:35-1:03:55
 Maybe

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:35-1:00:40
 she  left?  She  moved  to...  Well,  I'm  just  wondering.  Maybe  she  did.  I  don't  remember

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:40-1:00:40
 her

SPEAKER_01: 1:00:40-1:00:42
 leaving.  I  know

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:09-1:04:41
 she  was  in  our  junior  thing.  I  thought  I  had  seen  a  couple  of  pictures  of  her  in  there.  See,  this  was  senior,  sophomore,  junior,  junior.  I

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:21-1:01:26
 could  have  sworn  she  was  in  here,  but  I  guess  maybe  I'm  wrong.  Why  don't  you  ask  Marianne?

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:26-1:01:28
 Okay.  Ask  Marianne  Bernice  tomorrow.  Okay.

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:29-1:01:31
 Her  name  was  Barbara?  Barbara  Brisboy.  Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:31-1:01:33
 Brisboy.  Okay.  Nice  looking  gal.

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:33-1:01:34
 She's  blonde,  beautiful  gal.

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:35-1:04:55
 Barbara

SPEAKER_01: 1:01:35-1:01:50
 Brisboy.  You  know,  she  was  always  well -dressed.  Her  and  Nancy  used  to  be  probably  two  of  the  best  dressed  girls  in  school,  you  know,  other  folks  had  a  few  bucks  there.  And

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:50-1:02:06
 so,  and  what  about  the  other  direction?  So,  were  there  people,  sometimes,  you  know,  in  class,  you  have  these  people  that  capture,  like,  you  know,  everybody  makes  fun  of  them,  everybody  teases  them,  or  like  lots  of  people  tease  them  either  because  they  are  you  know  well  Richard  used

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:06-1:02:16
 to  tease  Richard  Huddleston  but  because  we  liked  them  not  because  he  was  goofy  but  everybody  liked  them  and  he  was  always  saying  crazy  things  and  he  was  funny  and  like  he

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:16-1:02:17
 was  a  funny  guy  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:17-1:02:19
 he  actually  was  pretty  funny  do

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:19-1:02:23
 you  remember  if  anybody  teased  the  Richard  Montague  no

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:21-1:02:26
 No,  I  I  don't  don't  think  think  so  so.  nothing  Well,  well  not  not  to  to  my  my  knowledge.

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:25-1:05:45
 knowledgeagu?

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:26-1:02:28
 It  may  have  happened,  but  I  don't  ever  remember  anything  like

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:28-1:02:54
 that.  So  you  interacted  with  him.  Did  you  have  a  sense  that  Richard,  because  later  in  life,  lots  of  people  that,  not  the  people  that  knew  him  well,  but  the  people  that  knew  him  just  superficially,  they  always  labeled  him  as  intimidating.  In  what?  Intimidating.  Oh,  okay.  And  I  always  wondered,  like,  how  can  a  man  who  is  like  five ,6",  kind  of  tiny  and  so  on,  but  they  said,  you  know,  intellectually  intimidating.  He  would  talk  to  you  and  you  would  feel  like,  uh,  he's  judging  me,  is  he?  Well,

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:54-1:02:55
 I  could  see  where  that  would

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:55-1:02:56
 happen

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:56-1:02:56
 in  college

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:56-1:02:57
 or  being  a  professor.  Okay,  you  can  imagine

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:57-1:02:59
 that  based  on  like  the...

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:59-1:06:19
 Oh

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:59-1:03:02
 yeah,  but  he  wasn't  like  that  in  high  school.  You're  never  intimidated.

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:02-1:03:03
 Okay,  okay.  Never.

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:03-1:03:06
 Okay.  I  mean,  you  know,  he's  just  a  regular  regular  guy  he's  just  smarter  than  everybody  else

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:06-1:03:07
 that's

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:07-1:03:13
 all  no  no  he  would  never  intimidate  me  and  i  was  i  was  probably  the  the  worst  student  in  that  class

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:13-1:03:16
 but  he  was  the  smartest  but  you  felt  comfortable  oh  yeah  yeah

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:16-1:03:19
 he  was  he  was  really  a  nice  guy  he

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:19-1:03:54
 really  was  oh  yeah  so  uh  ed  i  mean  this  was  really  really  great  because  it  opened  a  beautiful  window  on  this  world.  I  told  you  that  basically  I  know  nothing  about  that  time.  I  mean  I  know  something  about  his  time  at  Berkeley  because  I've  been  able  to  find  a  few  people  and  I  definitely  know  more  about  his  time  at  UCLA  because  I  know  more  people.  His  students  from  UCLA,  many  of  them  are  still  alive  so  I  was  able  to  interview  them.  There  are  some  images  and  pictures.  It's  closer  to  my  world  and  it's  closer  to  our  time.  But,  you  know,  the  Stockton  time  was  completely  a  mystery  until  I  ran  into  you  guys.

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:54-1:03:55
 Well,

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:55-1:03:55
 there  aren't

SPEAKER_01: 1:03:55-1:03:59
 many  of  us  left.  I  think  there's,  what,  like  about  20,  did  you  say,  or  22?

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:59-1:04:12
 Yeah,  this  is  the  list  that  I  found.  So  basically  around  20 -something,  yes.  And  then  we  don't  know  for  some  of  them.  And  I  know  Stater's  not  here,  I  know  that  for  sure.  And  then  I  have  a  couple  of  letters  that  got  back,  so  we  don't  know  what  that  means.  Yeah,  so  it  could

SPEAKER_01: 1:04:12-1:04:21
 only  be  like,  I  don't  know,  Don  Perano  just  went,  I  read  where  he  died  last  year.  Yeah,  they  wrote  it  here,  yeah.  Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:22-1:07:42
 I

SPEAKER_01: 1:04:22-1:04:27
 would,  you  know,  I'll  bet  there  isn't  more  than  15,  15  or  16  of  us  around,  to  tell  you  the  truth.

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:27-1:04:44
 And  in  fact,  actually,  while  I  was  arranging  the  trip  here,  that's  why  I  ended  up  extending  the  trip,  is  because  somebody  was  in  graduate  school  with  Richard,  who  then  became  a  famous  professor  at  Stanford.  His  name  was  Saul  Fefferman,  who

default: 1:05:09-1:05:41
 I  contacted  three  years  ago  when  I  started  this  project  and  supported  the  project  beautifully  and  nicely  with  suggestions.  Excuse  me,  I'll  take  that  to  my  daughter.  Please,  please.  I'll  be  right  back.
