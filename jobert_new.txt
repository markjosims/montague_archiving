SPEAKER_02: 0:00:00-0:00:06
 all your conversation, I don't want to take notes while you're talking.  And I want to get all the details so I don't make you worry about it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:06-0:00:10
 Yeah, well there's not too many details. How many details did you get from my friends?

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:10-0:00:22
 It was a great, that gathering, you know that we had this little gathering of four of you guys?  Yes, I know, we were supposed to go but then it was too late.  Mary was there, Ben was there, Bernice was there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:22-0:00:24
 Okay, she was a parenti.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:24-0:00:27
 Yes, and Alma. Alma Macini.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:27-0:00:35
 She knows Alma more than I know the others. Alma went to get married in, her husband was from Parma.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:35-0:00:41
 Sorry, I need to change the battery. Don't tell me any special details. No special details. I need to change the battery.

SPEAKER_00: 0:00:41-0:00:45
 Oh, he's out of battery. So you, so you were not born here, though.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:45-0:00:53
 No, I was born in Milan with my brother.  And then I lived there, I went to college there.  And then when I decided to go to graduate school,  I went to UCLA.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:53-0:00:54
 Oh.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:54-0:00:56
 But I was already 27 at that point.

SPEAKER_01: 0:00:56-0:00:58
 Oh, okay.  At graduate school, though, that's not that far.

SPEAKER_02: 0:00:58-0:01:05
 So I went to UCLA.  And then I had six years of graduate school there.  And then I, I'm gonna years of graduate school there and then I

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:05-0:01:07
 What kind of batteries do you need?

SPEAKER_02: 0:01:07-0:01:15
 Oh the ones that I have  I have everything packed  I prepared the little bags  Yes the little bags

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:15-0:01:17
 With the batteries

SPEAKER_02: 0:01:17-0:01:26
 Very helpful  You know you are, last night I was counting  You are the 115th person that I'm interviewing  Really? Yes, I started

SPEAKER_00: 0:01:26-0:01:32
 like three and a half years ago. Oh gosh, who was it that you were interviewing then? People from

SPEAKER_02: 0:01:32-0:02:10
 St. Mary's? Well, so people from all over the world because I started with the people that  was easier for me to find because they were academic people, so they were related to him  when he was a professor at UCLA. Okay.  You know, I knew that some of them were his students so I started from them and some of  them in the colleagues and they started making other names and so I started connecting with  those other people and then slowly I started going moving back in time so this now we are  in the 60s and then I went to the 50s, the mid 50s when he was studying at Berkeley.  And so I started to find people that the mid 50s when he was tired of Berkeley  There were his colleagues Berkeley and then I moved farther back

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:12-0:02:17
 But yeah  Back to go is the harder to remember

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:21-0:02:31
 In fact, I know I always apologize because okay perfect now because, okay, perfect, now this one should work. It's gonna work now. Oh, probably put the battery on the other.  Right.  That's Murphy's law, you know, when,  I checked last night and it says battery fine,  and of course, no.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:31-0:02:32
 Yes, and of course it's not.

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:32-0:02:36
 Let's see.  Sorry.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:36-0:02:38
 Maybe the battery's not working.  Let me change the battery.

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:38-0:02:39
 That's okay.  Yeah, you're right, let me change the battery.

SPEAKER_00: 0:02:39-0:02:41
 Because I do that, I keep some old ones

SPEAKER_02: 0:02:41-0:03:02
 because I think.  I mean, one is fine.  The reason why I always prefer to use two  is because once it happened to me that without realizing it  That one stopped working and it was the only one that I was using. Oh, so most of that interview was gone  Oh from then moment on I say no. These are like unique experiences and  Now it works. Okay.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:02-0:03:05
 So did you meet, was he ever your teacher then?

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:05-0:03:06
 No, no, because...

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:06-0:03:08
 Because he died so young.  Yes, accordion, let's see.

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:08-0:03:13
 Yeah, because he, so Richard died in 1971.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:13-0:03:24
 I know, and I could not figure out why he died so young until we found...  My daughter, my daughter, is with the pediatrician.  Okay, so...  So now I know.  Yes, that's a horrible thing.  It's terrible.

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:24-0:03:29
 I mean, I talked to the detective.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my goodness.

SPEAKER_00: 0:03:29-0:03:31
 It's a cold case.  Yes, you're right.

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:31-0:03:52
 It's still a cold case, right?  It is, yeah.  And the detective told me, Ivano, either somebody comes and says, I did it, or we are at this  point, given the little details that they collected at that time, and given the fact  that the investigation was done very, very  poorly.  Yeah, especially.  So, actually, if you don't mind, I just want to capture the full voice.  I'll put it here.

SPEAKER_01: 0:03:52-0:03:56
 Oh, yeah, wait, oh, wait.  Do we have to pull it?  I can do it.  Yeah, just pull it.

SPEAKER_02: 0:03:56-0:04:06
 Yeah, like that.  Okay, now you got it.  So that it's going to be.  Okay.  And so, I was saying that probably the detective told me that the case will never be solved.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:06-0:04:08
 And especially in that long time.

SPEAKER_02: 0:04:08-0:04:49
 Because he showed me the file that he left me.  It's a big file with all the information.  So they started doing some investigation and then they stopped.  The parents, Richard's parents were old at that time.  They were already in their early 80s and they died a few years after. Oh my goodness. And so he was the only child.  Okay. They had followed him every time he moved. So when he went to study to  Berkeley, they went to Berkeley. When he became a professor at UCLA, they went to Los  Angeles. Okay. Well that's great. Well that's good that they were close. And so probably his tragic loss must have killed him.  The father was already sick and he died one year later.  Oh my goodness.  And the mother died 20 years later.

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:49-0:04:50
 Oh, that's too bad.

SPEAKER_02: 0:04:50-0:04:51
 So it was a...

SPEAKER_00: 0:04:51-0:04:57
 Very tragic. But so you decided, your field, you teach at UC San Diego.  Yes, San Diego, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:04:57-0:08:46
 And your field is...  So the way it is connected to Richard is the following. So, my field is linguistics, so I train students and I  myself work on a variety of languages to try to understand what all languages have in common.  So, what are the principles that all languages follow and how do we discover that? Well,  we need to study each language at a time, try to understand the rules of that language,  you compare them with the rules of another language and you see what the differences  and similarities are. Oh, I see.  And since language is a complex object, you can do that on many levels.  You can focus on the sounds, for example, vowels and consonants of a certain language versus others.  You can focus on the words, how the words are formed in a language, and languages vary a lot.  You can concentrate on how languages put words together to form sentences.  Or you can focus on how languages convey meaning.  And that's my area. That's called semantics, the area where we study how do you convey  that meaning in that language? How do you convey the very same meaning in this other  language? Do they use similar tools or do they use different tools? And this was Richard's  great idea. So, he had done a career in logic and philosophy up to the mid-60s and he thought, well, logic,  it's that part, it's called mathematical logic.  So he studied, he got an MA in mathematics and a PhD in philosophy, but in philosophical  logic, so mathematical logic at Berkeley.  And for most of his career, he applied those tools to a variety of philosophical areas.  He was  in the philosophy department at UCLA. In the last three, four years of his life he had  this idea that what he had learned from mathematical logic, that way of reasoning, those kind of  mathematical tools could be applied to understand human language. And he showed us how you could  do it. So he wrote three very influential papers. They were very inspiring for young minds. They were wondering about similar things, but they  couldn't find solutions to those problems. And Richard said, OK, that's how you do it.  He wrote those three papers, and I found, I studied his archive at UCLA carefully, and  there were all these notes of the work that he wanted to do in the future. So clearly  there was an intent. It was just the beginning of a research project, but it was enough to get  the start.  And then a series of young minds were stimulated and a new field, the field of semantics, was  created.  So, we are now in the early 70s.  And this is my field.  So, when I was studying as a graduate student in Italy, as an undergraduate in Italy, I  started hearing, not hearing, like I saw his name mentioned on papers.  They were like, you know, Richard Montague, Montague grammar, which was the theory that  he suggested.  But nobody pronounced his name for me.  So actually I thought that he was Richard Montague.  French, French, French, French, old mathematician.  For sure that.  Then wrote these ununderstandable papers.  And so and that was my idea.  But still people were using it, were mentioning it. And then I decided to continue studying to do graduate school at UCLA  and it was at UCLA that my teacher told me, you know it's not Richard Montague, it's Richard  Montague. It was American actually it was in the philosophy department on the other like in the  other building. Oh my goodness. How funny that about you. Yeah and I remember that she said  and I know for sure that he didn't die old, he died young.  There was something strange with him.  He got murdered or something, but definitely it was American.  And it's weird.  The father on my field, and we know so little.  Because then I started asking, it was not just me that knew little about him.  Everybody knew little about him.  And so now we're talking about this idea came to my mind, like we were talking about like  15 years ago.  But I was a graduate student.  And no, the problem is that nobody would give me a job  to write a biography.  So you need to do serious linguistic work.  So that's what I did.  And so I wrote my dissertation.  I published my papers.  I became a professor at UC San Diego.  Three and a half years ago, they gave me tenure.  And as soon as they gave me tenure...

SPEAKER_00: 0:08:46-0:08:47
 Oh, after that long?

SPEAKER_02: 0:08:47-0:09:07
 So, tenure means that you are promoted in such a way that, well, they can still fire  you if you don't behave well.  Yes, yes.  But you don't need to prove that you're able to do research.  You're proved that you can do research, that you can publish and so on.  So you're safe as fire and you're freer to choose the topics to work on.  And then I said, okay, now I work on the biomechanics.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:07-0:09:08
 Oh, well that's good.

SPEAKER_02: 0:09:08-0:09:36
 That's where the connection is between me and Richard and why I want to...  Normally linguists don't do this.  So in fact, at the beginning they were looking at me in a kind of like,  are you sure you want to do this?  Some people even told me, well, Ivano, why don't you read...  because now I'm what is called  associate professor, which means mid-level professor with tenure.  The next step would be to become full professor.  And they said, why don't you wait to become full professor and then you write the book.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:36-0:09:39
 You know, it's also the point.  Well, it'll get you that point.

SPEAKER_02: 0:09:39-0:09:44
 Yeah, but the point is that I thought, well, full professor, when I got tenure, means to  wait another six, seven years.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:44-0:09:45
 Oh my god.

SPEAKER_02: 0:09:45-0:09:57
 And, you know, Richard, when I started the project, Richard would have been 82-83.  And I said, if I have any hope to find people that knew him.  You gotta get him while there's no one else.

SPEAKER_00: 0:09:57-0:09:59
 Yes!  They're not aware of the interview.

SPEAKER_02: 0:09:59-0:10:06
 Then I discovered that you guys are fantastic, because I met these wonderful people, and  I want to ask what the secret is.

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:06-0:10:07
 The secret of you.

SPEAKER_01: 0:10:07-0:10:08
 The olive oil and the red wine.

SPEAKER_02: 0:10:08-0:10:16
 But like as I mentioned in my email, Joe, like for example, initially I was supposed  to be here until Saturday and then I got the news.

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:16-0:10:20
 This professor at Stanford, Saul.  Yes, Saul Fefferman.  I looked him up too.  Yes, yes, Saul Fefferman.

SPEAKER_02: 0:10:20-0:10:25
 So who was, they went to graduate school together.  They had the same professor, Alfred Tarski.  And I saw, I read about something. So, they went to graduate school together. They had the same professor,

SPEAKER_00: 0:10:25-0:10:28
 Alfred Tarski. Wow. And I saw, I read about something Tarski.

SPEAKER_02: 0:10:28-0:11:28
 Yes, yes. So, Tarski was one of the most important logicians of the 20th century, moved to Berkeley  to run away from the Nazis, and created an empire between mathematics and philosophy  developing this field of studies. And so, Richard Montague and Saul Fefferman were among his best students.  And Saul Fefferman became a professor at Stanford in 1955, in 1956. And had been there since  then. And so three years ago I contacted him and his wife Anita, who wrote the biography  of their mentor, Alfred Tarski. And they were so nice, welcoming. I interviewed them because  they knew Richard personally.  Sure.  But they also knew a lot about the environment.  They gave me suggestions.  And then when two years ago I applied for a fellowship at Stanford, Saul wrote a letter  for me and I got the fellowship.  So I spent an entire year at Stanford working on the book.  So that was great.  And so then, you know, unfortunately three months ago he had a stroke. Oh.  And I went to visit him.  How old of a man was he?  He was 87.

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:28-0:11:30
 Oh, I'm 86.  I'm 86, so.

SPEAKER_02: 0:11:30-0:11:33
 Congratulations.  How did you do that?  You have to tell me.

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:33-0:11:43
 I don't know.  It's that Italian inheritance, I guess.  I know, I know.  The good genes.  The good genes.  The very good genes, yes.  Okay, so you did get to at least physically talk to him.

SPEAKER_02: 0:11:43-0:11:54
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We interacted a lot. No, that's why I felt that I wanted talk to him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We interacted a lot.  No, that's why I felt that I wanted to go to the gathering because I...  I mean, he's somebody who has affected both my intellectual, but he also became a personal friend.  He came to visit me in San Diego.

SPEAKER_00: 0:11:54-0:11:55
 Oh, that's nice.

SPEAKER_02: 0:11:55-0:12:00
 And I was there when he lost his wife. Anita died one and a half years ago.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:00-0:12:01
 Oh, she was already gone.

SPEAKER_02: 0:12:01-0:12:10
 Yes. So one and a half years ago when I was at Stanford, she died.  Oh, dear.  So we were like even closer because I tried to stay close to him and so on.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:10-0:12:15
 And I really wanted to be there. Well that's good. Well it's good that you were here.

SPEAKER_02: 0:12:15-0:12:25
 It worked out fine. God works in miracles. In fact you never know. But the other thing that I  learned is like okay you don't wait 10 years for this project.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:25-0:12:37
 No.  You don't get away with it.  No, because we started in 44, right?  To school.  Would you like something to drink?  We have iced tea, a little water.  Just some plain water.  Water.  Is it OK with a little ice in it?

SPEAKER_02: 0:12:37-0:12:38
 That would be perfect.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:38-0:12:40
 Well, it's already cold, honey.  I know.

SPEAKER_02: 0:12:40-0:12:42
 Actually, if it's already cold, don't pour the ice.  If it's already cold, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:12:42-0:13:02
 Yeah, it's been in the refrigerator.  OK, then I'll explain to you. Anyway, it's already called Dompoudian. It's been in the refrigerator. I forgot to explain to you.  Anyway, it was 1944 and when you first contacted me, I went,  oh, I remember Richard Montague because he was quite...  what's the word I want?  You can tell by looking at him that he was very intellectual.

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:02-0:13:04
 Oh, you could already see.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:04-0:13:12
 You could tell by looking at him  and the way he dressed.  He looked like, well you saw the picture I sent you.  He looks like a little old man.  Yeah, that picture, you see that, Cole?

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:12-0:13:13
 Yes, yes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:13-0:13:16
 You know, I mean, the kids at school  never wore those kind of things.

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:16-0:13:22
 In fact, actually, you're right  because I was comparing like, this is a group picture.  Yeah.  He appears at the very end.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:22-0:13:22
 Yeah, he's at the very end.

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:22-0:13:23
 And he looks different from the last picture.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:23-0:13:30
 Yeah, doesn't he look different?  I mean, there's not too many boys in there, but he never dressed like...  No, you're right.  There's one with the boys.

SPEAKER_02: 0:13:30-0:13:32
 Look at this one with the boys.

SPEAKER_00: 0:13:32-0:14:08
 And I cannot find my other two yearbooks.  And I'm hoping somebody at the thing had the last two, the 47 and the 49.  No, I mean.  No, we're Italian.  I know, I know.  We don't bake, so forget that.  No, I don't bake.  I used to bake.  I don't bake anymore.  But anyway, I can't find those other two books because I had this picture of graduation in  them.  And I was hoping that maybe one of those girls, ladies, had them.  They had them.

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:08-0:14:11
 Oh good.  But do you have your graduation picture?  Otherwise I can send it to you because I do have it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:11-0:14:12
 Oh you do have it?

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:12-0:14:14
 Yes, I can send it to you because...

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:14-0:14:18
 Oh see, it's two books are here somewhere.  I know they're here.

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:18-0:14:22
 Those are the early ones.  Those are the early ones.  1943 and 1944.  1944, correct.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:22-0:14:25
 Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, those are the old ones.  And see, the new ones have hard

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:25-0:14:30
 covers on them. Yes, you're right. And I know they're here. So, 46 and 47 were the last

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:30-0:14:41
 two. No, that should be... When did you graduate? I graduated in 47. 47, like Richard. Richard.  We'd love to have... If you have an email, you can email us. Sure, sure. I can make a

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:41-0:14:46
 high-definition copy. So, which also means if you want to print it out, it comes out nicely.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:46-0:14:49
 My daughter is a graphic designer.

SPEAKER_02: 0:14:49-0:14:53
 She went to the USA.  So, you want me to send it to your email then?  Sure.

SPEAKER_00: 0:14:53-0:15:03
 Oh yeah, that would be fine.  I'll send it to you as soon as I go home tomorrow.  Well, no hurry, no hurry, no hurry, you know.  But anyway, I had them and I know they're in this house somewhere, but who knows where.

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:03-0:15:05
 Okay, then you know that they're here.  I know they're here, house somewhere, but who knows where. Okay, then you know that they're here.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:05-0:15:12
 I know they're here, I just don't know where.  I have so much stuff.  You got that information.  Yes, yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:12-0:15:20
 And I also went to St. Mary's High School.  Oh, did you?  The new building, because I went to talk to...  I was in touch with Rose Leonardini.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:20-0:15:22
 Yes, the name is very familiar.

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:22-0:15:46
 Yeah, so she was the year after you guys. Yes. And she's now... She was a teacher then at St. Mary's later. Yes, the name is very familiar. So she was the year after you guys. Yes.  And she's now, she was a teacher then at St. Mary's later.  And then now she's dealing with the alumni association.  Oh yes.  She helped them to keep track of the alumni, to organize events.  And so by her, she put me in touch with somebody who manages the library at St. Mary's and  they found some old issues  of the kettle.

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:46-0:15:48
 Oh, the kettle!  That was our paper!

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:48-0:15:49
 Yes!

SPEAKER_00: 0:15:49-0:15:57
 Yes!  That was the paper, yes.  And I think in the book it shows the kettle staff on one of those things.  Yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:15:57-0:16:01
 I was wondering, in fact, that's where I said, what was the kettle?  Oh, it was the newspaper.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:01-0:16:02
 That was the newspaper at the school.

SPEAKER_02: 0:16:02-0:16:10
 And I wondered, are there some old issues?  Well, let me ask this person, her name is Stephanie.  Stephanie may know.  In fact, Stephanie found like six or seven old issues from 1944 to 1947.

SPEAKER_01: 0:16:10-0:16:11
 Wow.

SPEAKER_02: 0:16:11-0:16:18
 Wow.  So I went there, I made copies of them.  I found reference to Richard, meetings that you guys had, things that Richard was playing.

SPEAKER_00: 0:16:18-0:17:11
 Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, see, they reminded me, when I did finally contact Mary, what she was a feeling  before, she never answered me back because I told her I could not come at 4 o'clock,  but if you could make the thing earlier because it was hotter than heck that day.  And going from here to there, driving and then coming home, you know, I thought no,  that's not going to work.  So that's... Well work so that's a driver  and I had something that evening so no I understand yeah but then with the  traffic and oh yeah it's it's traffic is getting horrendous oh no I appreciate  that you know I was so but anyway and I lost my train of thought see I was  talking about this I think yeah these poor things are all shot. But the green and white and the other one, they're hard copies.  Yeah, you're right.

SPEAKER_02: 0:17:11-0:17:20
 We were still under the war there, so probably there were fewer sources.  And then they go, it'll be fancy, also the paper is a little bit fancy.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:20-0:17:49
 And then this was our 60th school reunion.  Oh, can I take a look at it?  Yeah, but he was already gone then.  Where did you see the lady that was in the same book?  In this book.  Oh, in that book, okay.  See, they sent me, this is a book that I got, I must have bought it.  And it's called the St. Mary's Directory of Alumni.  But it's a 2000 edition, okay?  But when I was looking through here one day,  looking for some people, I found another Montague.

SPEAKER_01: 0:17:49-0:17:52
 But I think that if he's an only child,  then no one else is.

SPEAKER_00: 0:17:52-0:18:07
 Well, I don't know, but I'm saying,  where is it?  It's right here.  What's the name?  Wait a minute.  Mrs. Catherine Montague.  And she was year of 71. So the class of 71. So it has to be after me.

SPEAKER_02: 0:18:07-0:19:39
 Yeah, so what I know is that there was another Montague family that was not related.  Oh, not related.  And probably, so it appears around the same time when Montague's parents are in Stockton,  but I reconstructed the genealogy of the family. It was not, I mean, at a certain point, I don't know, maybe two centuries earlier, they were related. But definitely at the  time in Stockholm they were not related because Montague's father came from  Vermont. He was an only child. He came from Vermont with his parents.  It was 1910. So he was 20 and I think at that time he was in the Navy. Then he left the  Navy and he started being trained as an electrician for the Pacific Telephone  and Telegram Company. Initially they were living in San Jose. Actually Santa  Barbara first. They were living in Santa Barbara. Richard's  father was early 20s. Richard's mother was a little bit younger, like four years younger.  And she was born and grew up in Lompoc, which is north of Santa Barbara.  Lompoc, I know where that is. Yes, I know where that is.  At a certain point, Montague's father moved there because they were putting the phone  lines along.  Probably that's how they met.  So they got married in 1915.  But the interesting thing is that they were married for 15 years before they had Richard.

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:39-0:19:40
 Wow.

SPEAKER_02: 0:19:40-0:19:47
 So the mother was 36 and the father was 40 when they had him, which I think it was not  that common at that time.  Do you agree, Joe?

SPEAKER_00: 0:19:47-0:20:24
 No.  No.  I...  Everybody had a...  Yeah, well, see, my mother and father had me, but I was an only child, so...  Like him.  Well, how old was your mother?  She was young.  My mother, she was...  No, she was younger.  Yeah, she was younger.  And my dad had come over from Italy when he was 15.  Uh-huh. Okay. And my dad had come over from Italy when he was 15. And he had to go to start school when he was 15 and he had to start in the 5th grade,  which was a little demeaning in those days, but that's what he did.  He did go to school, then he became a citizen, then he got a job, and then he met my mother, and then they had me.

SPEAKER_02: 0:20:24-0:20:30
 So tell me, I'm a little bit curious about your personal history if you don't mind.  So your father came from Italy.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:30-0:20:31
 Came from Italy with my grandma.

SPEAKER_02: 0:20:31-0:20:33
 With your grandma and where did they go?

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:33-0:20:38
 They stopped I believe in New York first.  Well they had Ellis Island.

SPEAKER_01: 0:20:38-0:20:39
 Ellis Island for sure.

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:39-0:20:56
 And then I don't know exactly, I wish I would, you know, hindsight, you try to ask all these  questions when you're younger but you don't think about them, all right?  But I think my grandmother had another son, but from a different husband.  He was in New York.

SPEAKER_02: 0:20:56-0:20:58
 So, that's your, is that your grandma?

SPEAKER_00: 0:20:58-0:21:19
 My grandma, which my father's mother, she had another son, but her first husband died.  Then she married a Mancini.  And then she married...  And the Mancini husband came over here to look for work.  He came to look for work in California.

SPEAKER_02: 0:21:19-0:21:22
 On the railroad.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:22-0:21:53
 My grandfather.  Well, he was supposed to call her over. Call for her and my grandfather to come.  Yes.  And she finally got tired of waiting.  And she got, I've still got the trunk out in the back that's sort of shot, but my granddaughter  wants to remake it, but I don't think she can do it.  And it says, Napoli, they sailed from Naples to, with my grandfather who was 50.  She decided, I'm not waiting anymore.  She's not waiting anymore.  So she knew he was in the Stockton area.

SPEAKER_02: 0:21:53-0:21:54
 Wow, what a brave woman.

SPEAKER_00: 0:21:54-0:22:21
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.  From Naples coming over?  Naples came over with my father and he said,  I remember he telling me it was like a cattle car.  It was in those days, he said it was horrible.  And the reason he told us that was  because we used to go on cruises with him  and he goes, this is a lot better than his first cruise.  So anyway, that's how she came to Stockton.  And then they had relatives, cuginis  and stuff like that in that area.

SPEAKER_02: 0:22:21-0:22:22
 So she knew that he was here.

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:22-0:22:24
 Yeah, she knew, she found him.

SPEAKER_02: 0:22:24-0:22:29
 Oh, I was about to ask, she found him? She found him. Alone or with somebody else? She found him,

SPEAKER_00: 0:22:29-0:23:31
 no, I guess he was alone and he was working for the PG&E and they were digging with the digging,  you know, the street up. Yeah, so that's how the family reunited. That's how my family reunited.  So that's how the family reunited. That's how my family reunited.  I think she, I remember her telling me or telling my mother  that when she got here, he wanted to have another child.  And she said, no!  He said, no, that's it.  So that's how they got to Stockton.  And they did have some relatives in Stockton.  Oh, there were some family members. Yes, some family, cojines and stuff like that.  And they stayed in Stockton?  And they stayed in Stockton.  They built a house with the basement so they can make the wine.  And we lived with my grandmother and grandfather.  And my mother had always wanted to have her own house, but poor lady never did.  So then my grandma and grandpa passed away. And then my mother and father had the house.  So that's where I was born, in that house.  On Lafayette Street.

SPEAKER_02: 0:23:31-0:23:32
 Do you remember which part of Stockholm?

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:32-0:23:37
 Oh yeah, 1718 East Lafayette Street, off of Wilson Way.  If you've been on Wilson Way.

SPEAKER_02: 0:23:37-0:23:45
 So let me try to get, okay.  So the map that I have in my mind,  so we are the railroad.  Are you south of the railroad or north of the railroad?

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:45-0:23:50
 I'm west of, well, the railroad runs like this.

SPEAKER_02: 0:23:50-0:23:52
 Does it run like east-west?

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:52-0:23:54
 No, it goes north-south.

SPEAKER_02: 0:23:54-0:23:55
 Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_00: 0:23:55-0:24:10
 I do believe it goes north-south.  Because the railroad station used to be up on Weber and,  oh shoot, what's the other street there?  It's been a long time.  It's on Weber, the old,  there were two railroad stations,  Southern Pacific and Western Pacific.

SPEAKER_02: 0:24:10-0:24:11
 Oh, you're right, I saw the old maps, you're right.

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:11-0:24:18
 And it ran this way, and we were south,  not south of it, we were actually east of the thing.

SPEAKER_02: 0:24:18-0:24:20
 So you were Lafayette?

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:20-0:24:21
 On Lafayette and Wilson Way.

SPEAKER_02: 0:24:21-0:24:22
 Wilson Way, okay.

SPEAKER_00: 0:24:22-0:24:26
 It's a real crappy area.  Well, now it's crappy, those days it used to be Italian.

SPEAKER_02: 0:24:26-0:25:25
 I think Richard was living in the very same area. Really? No, not in high school.  Oh, maybe. Where did you go to elementary school? I went to Fair Oaks which is not there anymore.  They tore it down which was on Main Street. Richard went to a school called Jackson School.  That was from first to fifth grade and then went  to El Dorado oh that's North area yeah because the family initially was moved  it was living on what's the name of the street  Hunt South Hunter which is in the southern part in a duplex a little  duplex that still exists but it was you know you can see from the duplex it was  like there were two units to one one-bedroom apartment units, the  grandparents were in one, and Montague's parents and Richard were in the other. But then when it was 10, so at the end of the  fifth grade, you see that the family went up in the social scale because they  moved to... They went to the North Area. They went to the North area. Yeah, right.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:25-0:25:27
 So did my cousins.  Yeah, okay.

SPEAKER_02: 0:25:27-0:25:41
 My cousins went to the North area.  They went to these, like, they changed a few houses, but it was like, one was Acacia Street.  Oh yeah, Acacia is by the school.  Exactly.  Another one was, and then they chose one very, very close to Van Buren.  Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:41-0:25:47
 Right behind, right next to the school.  Yes, that's behind, where the hospital is.  The Danumrand Hospital is still there, I think.

SPEAKER_02: 0:25:47-0:25:56
 So that's why I was interested in it.  So it sounds like the area where you were growing up is very close to where Richard was growing up.

SPEAKER_00: 0:25:56-0:25:58
 Well, it could have been. I don't know what street he was on.

SPEAKER_02: 0:25:58-0:26:02
 So South Hunter and Jackson, I think.

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:02-0:26:14
 Oh.  I don't know where Jackson is.  No, I don't know Jackson, but I know South Hunter. He was  further over, he was on the other side of the tracks. Okay yes probably.  He was on the west side of the tracks and we were on the east side.

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:14-0:26:17
 So can you tell a little bit more about your neighborhood, what it looked

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:17-0:26:25
 like, who was living there? Oh well we had our relatives were there, the Gaddys  were there and they went to St. Mary's also.

SPEAKER_02: 0:26:26-0:26:27
 But just Italians?

SPEAKER_00: 0:26:27-0:27:38
 No, in those days, yeah, mostly Italians because the Caceras lived on the corner and I lived,  we lived two houses where they had a piece of property between us but then they ended up building  a house for their daughter and there were Ricicis. So they were basically, we were across the street  with the Gaddis, two houses over were the Parnis.  So they were basically, it was basically  a nice Italian neighborhood then.  And the house is still there.  And so I really haven't gone by to see it  after my mother passed away,  but I'm scared to go look at it now  because I don't know  what it's gonna look like, you know?  And then we go to the cemetery there once  to bring flowers, but then we still have relatives there.  So the Gatti family, their kids grew up  and then their kids are now my daughter's age,  and so she goes to the cemetery with her,  because her father is buried not too far from my folks.  And so she goes and puts flowers for my dad,  because we don't get there that often anymore.  So then we got relatives in San Francisco too,  on my husband's side,  that we don't get there too often either,  but we try to go every so often.

SPEAKER_02: 0:27:38-0:27:40
 So there was a large group of Italians in there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:40-0:27:41
 Oh yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 0:27:41-0:27:45
 So do you remember if there were also other groups,  like for example

SPEAKER_00: 0:27:51-0:28:34
 where there um like where there like Asians in that area? There were where there like black people? Not not at that time no no in fact next door uh went right out of my head.  Service there were some more the Cervi C C EE-R-V-I, they were Italian also, Palmera, I remember Palmera,  and around the corner there was Italians too, so basically it was a little Italian neighborhood,  older neighborhood, but my cousins across the street when they decided to build the cross town  freeway, their house was in the way, so they decided to buy a house in the north area. Oh, that's when they...  And that's when they moved and then they tore their... all those houses on the other side. In fact...  Well, I hope you stayed. Didn't you stay overnight there? You're staying there? Yeah. You stayed in the

SPEAKER_02: 0:28:34-0:28:50
 north area, I hope. Well, so... Well, there's not much... That was my third time in Stockholm, so I got  familiar a little bit. Okay. But actually, I did drive through those areas during the day.  They told me, be careful, just drive there, stay in the car and move on.

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:50-0:28:51
 Yeah, well, it's a shame now.

SPEAKER_02: 0:28:51-0:28:58
 I mean, it was fine, but I don't feel comfortable in just walking around those areas.  Because I want to take a look at the place where Richard was growing up.

SPEAKER_00: 0:28:58-0:29:05
 Oh, okay.  Well, South Hunter might be not as bad.  Is it still bad?  It's probably worse than my neighborhood.  This was her house.  This house. Oh, well, that's nice. It's a bad? It's probably worse than my neighborhood. This

SPEAKER_02: 0:29:05-0:29:40
 was her house. Oh, well, that's nice. Better than South Hunter. Oh, yeah. Well, if you  can do a search like with, it's 1201 South Hunter. You'll see, I mean, you'll see. The  first time that I went to see it, it looked even scarier because it was right at the end  of the real estate crisis.  So probably it had begun like, I say,  when the house, somebody owned it,  was not able to pay the mortgage.  So they let it go.  Yeah, they let it go.  So they put, you know when they put the wood panels

SPEAKER_00: 0:29:40-0:29:41
 on the windows?  Yes, yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:29:41-0:29:42
 They say, okay, they're gonna demolish,

SPEAKER_01: 0:29:42-0:29:43
 let me take pictures.

SPEAKER_02: 0:29:43-0:30:10
 Yes, yes.  And then actually, a couple of years later, somebody bought bought it. They renovated a little bit, nothing made.  Yeah, that's what they did. And now I checked because I went to the registrar's office. Oh,  okay. Oh, sorry, the recorder's office. Yes, county recorder. Yeah, and to check to see how  many properties the Montagues family owned. Yeah. I was able to see who owns that building now.  So it was sold, the duplex,  it's owned by, sounds like a Latino family.

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:10-0:30:14
 Yeah, well that's, there's a lot of Hispanics  in that area now.  I'm impressed.

SPEAKER_02: 0:30:14-0:30:26
 I need that street number again.  It's 1201 South Hunter.  So that's the neighborhood.  I agree with you, probably in those days  must have looked better because I can't imagine them living in...

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:26-0:30:31
 And then the freeway went through  and messed everything all up.  And then even my other cousin...  So what did your family do?

SPEAKER_02: 0:30:31-0:30:33
 My dad...  Did you guys stay there or you moved somewhere else?

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:33-0:30:37
 No, no, that was it.  I moved once and that was to San Francisco

SPEAKER_02: 0:30:37-0:30:44
 when I got married.  Which meant that you had to...  So when you went to San Marys, for you it was quite a...

SPEAKER_00: 0:30:44-0:31:07
 Oh yeah, it was a chore. Oh! Yeah. Oh! you had to so when you went to St. Mary's for you was quite a yeah I'm  gonna show you that's yeah oh yeah good no sidewalks not a good, no, no. We had sidewalks. It's like a duplex. It is. That's it. The grandparents

SPEAKER_02: 0:31:07-0:31:30
 were living on one side. And it doesn't look that big. No, it was a one, each unit was  650 square feet. Oh my goodness. Oh my gosh. And that's why you totally see that they went  up the social scale because then when they bought the other place, they were real houses,  like two or three bedroom houses in a much nicer area yeah I drove by the yeah they are still very nice areas oh sure nice houses

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:30-0:31:36
 especially it hasn't changed that much that way yeah uh but in our area it has charter way oh

SPEAKER_02: 0:31:36-0:31:45
 he's charter yeah oh yeah i know where it's at well my grandmother i'm curious would you mind  show the the map where they lived?

SPEAKER_00: 0:31:47-0:32:10
 Yeah, well, my other grandmother, because I had my mother's mother lived in Stockton also,  and she came from Italy too, and she had three husbands. They all died, I mean two of them died,  and then she ended up, you know, having... And she lived on East Hazleton, which you probably crossed on your way to Hunter. Yes, yes, yes, yes. You guys were all there.

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:10-0:32:14
 Well, we were not that far away. So, but then when you went to high school, how did you go to Santa Maria?

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:14-0:32:38
 Well, I took the bus. And once in a blue moon, I had a friend that was Portuguese  that lived around the corner from me, Azevedo, my friend Lucille. Oh yeah, I saw her name. Yeah, she's in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lucille and I used to take the bus. She's here somewhere. I know I have her  picture. There's Alma. Yes. There's Alma. Where's Lucille? Okay, but Lucille was... I see Richard

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:38-0:32:52
 here. Oh, she's got to be here. This is the senior choir, this is the senior choir.  They've got all sorts of pictures.  Yes, this is a picture from the sophomore year. I don't know if you see it.  I actually have the names here.

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:52-0:32:56
 Yeah, well, Lucille Poussa.  Lucille Alzavedo.

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:56-0:32:58
 Alzavedo, let's see if I see Alzavedo.

SPEAKER_00: 0:32:58-0:32:59
 And where is she on this picture?

SPEAKER_02: 0:32:59-0:33:05
 No, because you guys were too many in that class, so they split you into two classes.  Oh, is that what it was? Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:05-0:33:24
 Well I remember going from Fair Oaks High School, grammar school, to St. Mary's High School  and they put us in a different class because we were from a public school who weren't up,  I guess they figured we weren't smart enough to go and then most of the kids went to St. Agnes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:33:24-0:33:25
 Yes, the private. Okay, well they, of the kids went to St. Agnes. Yes, the private.

SPEAKER_00: 0:33:25-0:33:46
 Okay, well, I didn't go to St. Agnes,  the Catholic school.  And those people were ahead of us, you know,  at the beginning.  Well, because, and I hate to say it,  but now it's still kind of the same here.  Okay, so let me see.  This is South Wilson.  This is that Highway 40.  Let me point you through.  Okay, do you mind if I show swing a little bit so I can see?

SPEAKER_02: 0:33:46-0:34:00
 No, go right ahead. Here, this will let you take it.  Oh, ok. Here's the... yeah, then you're right. That's the railroad as you were saying.  That's Chargers Way. Ok. I see.  So, see, he was on the other side of it.  He was on the other side. Is that correct? Yeah.  Because he was down El Dorado. Yeah, he was in this area here.  And this whole neighborhood is really creepy now.

SPEAKER_01: 0:34:00-0:34:02
 Really crappy. I mean, it's...

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:02-0:34:05
 The house is... The South area is really bad.  Oh, I see, I see house is the south area is really bad

SPEAKER_02: 0:34:05-0:34:37
 I see I see it's really bad there's a lot of games oh yeah oh I've been here oh yeah  probably the reason why I've been here because in this area here it's right  here I think they now they have the school district oh that's the office  that the office okay because I was looking for Richard's records and  transcripts if there was anything available so they gave me the address I remember the other day I was driving through the's records, transcripts, if there was anything available.  So they gave me the address,  and I remember the other day I was driving  through the Horea Road, you cross it,  and you're in this neighborhood like, okay.  So I wanted to get out of the car.  No, really, because the house in front of it was like,  what are those guys doing there?

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:37-0:34:56
 They're just sitting around.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very sad.  It's not good.  It's very sad that it's going on now.  They don't have jobs,  and they don't really care if they have jobs, I guess.  Yeah, I know.  It was a little bit not good.  I'm still looking for Lucille.  But anyway.  Lucille has got to be here because she and I...  I saw her name.  I totally saw her name.  I know.  Here, L. Azevedo.  Okay, now if I can...

SPEAKER_02: 0:34:56-0:34:59
 There she is.  Do you find her?  Yes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:34:59-0:35:10
 Because I have the congratulations picture.  I do believe that's her.  Uh-huh.  But that girl...  No, right there.  This one? That's Frances Chisholm.  Oh, wow.  You remember them very well.  Yes, I can remember.  That's Lucille.  And she was living near you?

SPEAKER_02: 0:35:10-0:35:12
 She lived around the corner on Sonora Street.  And she had a car?

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:12-0:35:13
 No, she didn't have a car.

SPEAKER_02: 0:35:13-0:35:14
 Oh, you guys would go together?

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:14-0:35:16
 Her mother had a car.  I tell you, her mother had one of these old Buicks with the trunk in the back that must

SPEAKER_02: 0:35:16-0:35:17
 have been a 19-something.

SPEAKER_00: 0:35:17-0:35:55
 And every once in a while, her mother would take us to school.  But otherwise, we had to go to school.  And she had a car?  No, she didn't have a car.  Oh, you guys would go together?  Her mother had a car.  I tell you, her mother had one of these old Buicks with the trunk in the back that must  have been a 19 something  and every once in a while her mother would take us to school but otherwise we  had to we walked and and then we took the bus because Main Street had the bus  and we took the bus we had to change buses two buses to get to West Road  how long would it take you to get there? A while. And then during Lent, we would walk downtown  and have breakfast, and then we would walk  all the way across the railroad track,  and then downtown, then go catch the bus,  and then go to school.

SPEAKER_02: 0:35:55-0:36:01
 Wow.  So just to have an idea,  do you remember what time school would start, roughly?

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:01-0:36:41
 In those days, God, I don't remember.  Probably 8.30, 9 o'clock.  So you were getting up pretty early to do all this. Oh yeah.  And did school end like at noon or you would continue in the afternoon? No, no, we didn't get off until 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  And then we would do vice versa, come back on the bus. No, because my parents both worked. My dad worked at Fiberboard, which is, I don't know what it's called now.  They made boxes and cardboard boxes.  And then my mother did too.  She worked at the same place.  And so my grandmother and grandfather took care of me.  They were the ones at home.  And so, no, no, my grandma didn't drive.

SPEAKER_02: 0:36:41-0:36:48
 And you mentioned that Lucille's mother had a car.  Was it common for families to have a car in those days?  You had a car.

SPEAKER_00: 0:36:48-0:36:58
 Yeah, we had a car.  My dad had a car.  He had a Plymouth.  Yeah, oh yeah.  He had a Plymouth.  Then he went from a Plymouth to a Chrysler.  Oh yeah, that was his big deal, going to a Chrysler.

SPEAKER_02: 0:36:58-0:37:06
 And so do you remember, you said that you  went from first to eighth grade.  You went to a public school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:06-0:37:09
 They skipped me.  That's why I graduated at 17.

SPEAKER_02: 0:37:09-0:37:31
 You read my mind.  So how did you work?  Because probably Richard did something similar to what you did.  Oh, I'm sure he did.  Because you were born in 1930.  Correct.  And Richard was born in 1930, but normally people from 1930, because when I talk to your  classmates, they were all 1929.  And then I did a little bit of math and said they were right, because you had to go from  first to eighth grade.

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:31-0:37:41
 You started at sixth.  Yeah, well I skipped one grade and I think it was either the fourth or the fifth.  They don't do that anymore now.  But I got skipped in grammar school.

SPEAKER_01: 0:37:41-0:37:43
 You had to if he was very smart.

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:43-0:37:48
 Oh yeah, well I didn't think I was that smart,  but they thought I was, so they skipped me.

SPEAKER_02: 0:37:48-0:37:50
 It was a suggestion coming from the teachers?

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:50-0:37:50
 Yes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:37:50-0:37:51
 You can go ahead.

SPEAKER_00: 0:37:51-0:37:57
 Yeah.  Okay, that's how it works.  That's how it worked then.  I don't know, I can't even remember.

SPEAKER_02: 0:37:57-0:38:16
 No, thank you, that's very useful,  because I kept wondering, what happened to Richard?  I mean, I know that he started St. Mary's in 1943.  He probably skipped too.  And I know that he was born in 1930, I know that he started St. Mary's in 1943. He probably skipped it. And I know that he was born in 1930.  I know that for sure.  So there is something there, like,  that either he started early, but I  don't think you were allowed to start at five elementary school.  No, no, I don't think so.  He must have done the skipping.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:16-0:38:21
 Yeah, because I don't even know if I went to kindergarten.  I think we started in those days at first grade.

SPEAKER_02: 0:38:21-0:38:21
 First grade.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:21-0:38:22
 I don't think they had.

SPEAKER_02: 0:38:22-0:38:25
 And you started at year six, and then at a certain point,  his teacher suggested he skip it. He suggested I skip the grade. And it started at year six and then at a certain point a teacher suggested...

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:25-0:38:32
 He suggested I skip the grade.  And it wasn't just me, it was a group of kids.  And I don't remember who was with the thing.  No, no, no, that's very useful.

SPEAKER_02: 0:38:32-0:38:34
 I kept wondering if it was possible.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:34-0:38:42
 No, that's why I skipped.  And that's why I graduated at 17.  And Richard must have too.  Because he was, although he was September, I was April.

SPEAKER_02: 0:38:42-0:38:43
 Uh-huh, yes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:38:43-0:38:57
 So, my birthday, yeah. he was September, I think.  And because I remember right,  I still have it.  Amazing, amazing.  No, no, but I read the stuff.

SPEAKER_02: 0:38:57-0:39:00
 So can I ask you April when?  Because I was born April 30th.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:00-0:39:10
 I'm April 13th.  She's the Italian lucky number.  See, I'm the lucky number. That's why I'm still here. April 30th is She's the Italian lucky number. See, I'm the lucky number.  That's why I'm still here.  April 30th is a dear friend of hers birthday.

SPEAKER_02: 0:39:10-0:39:18
 Oh, yeah.  So, Jo, can I ask you, the decision to go to St. Mary's  was your decision, your parents' decision?  My parents, I think, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:18-0:39:24
 Stockton High School was the only other  high school, and that was just as far.  Well, not quite as far.

SPEAKER_02: 0:39:24-0:39:32
 So, you think it was just an issue of convenience? Because Stockton High School was also much  bigger, that's what I know, it was much bigger, there were many more students. St. Mary's

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:32-0:39:41
 was cozier and smaller. Yes, and it was smaller, I don't even know  if the building is still there. The building is there and then the church was around the

SPEAKER_02: 0:39:41-0:39:58
 corner, the Annunciation. And they just built a new church.  The new Annunciation, no, no, at that time, the new Annunciation was built in 1940, 41.  Yes.  They built a new church, but the high school building was already there.  Yeah.  And now it still exists, but these days it's used as an elementary school.

SPEAKER_00: 0:39:58-0:40:03
 Oh, so they are still using it.  Yeah, they're still using it.  Yeah, because it's up and down.  You know, you had to take care of it.

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:03-0:40:06
 It's called St. Agnes.  St. Agnes. Oh, really? Because St. Agnes was not close using it. Yeah, because it's up and down. It's called St. Agnes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:06-0:40:39
 Oh really, because St. Agnes was not close to that. Now it's there. Now it's there. Oh, okay.  But you can tell me how much your parents paid for tuition. Oh yeah. Do you remember that too?  We paid three dollars a month. What? Wait a minute, there's something better.  $3 a month. Wait a minute, there's something better. The non-Catholics had to pay $5 a month. They discriminated in those days. Are you sure about it? I am positive.  Because Richard was not Catholic. I am positive. No, Montague was more English.

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:39-0:40:47
 In fact, I went to check on the transcripts. I got a copy of his  transcript from St. Mary's. Yeah. And you can see that they would write if you were Catholic or not.  Yes.

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:47-0:40:50
 You said non-Catholic.  Yeah.  And the non-Catholics paid five.

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:50-0:40:52
 So you're sure about it?

SPEAKER_00: 0:40:52-0:40:58
 I'm almost positive about it.  Those other ladies didn't know that?  No, they didn't remember.  Oh, no.

SPEAKER_02: 0:40:58-0:41:46
 One of them, no, one of them remember.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, all your pictures are falling down.  One of them remembered that the school had a deal.  I said what she told me.  There was a deal.  Yes, there was a deal because there were two of them going to school.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And then you could discuss a deal and she said, well, from what I remember, I think  my sister and I together, yeah, I remember that my parents were writing a $6 check every  month.  Every month.  So I assumed it was  $3 for each of us.  Yes.  Okay.  That's probably true.  But then I said, do you know if there was any distinction between Catholic and non-Catholic?  Because they still do it these days.  Oh, yeah.  I went on their website.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So if you are Catholic, you pay $8,500 a year.  If you are non-Catholic, you pay $8,900.  So it's not tremendous difference. No, but it's... But still, yeah, there is still a year. Oh, if you are non-Catholic, you pay $8,900. So it's not tremendous. No,

SPEAKER_00: 0:41:46-0:42:39
 but there is still a difference. No, but I do remember that because we paid my dad, we  paid $3 a month. You know what I paid for my girls' Catholic high school here in town  that plays basketball against St. Mary's? Yeah, I argue with them all the time. It's  a phenomenal basketball, girls' basketball team. Yeah, St. Francis. They're girls' basketball,  they win the state championship all the time. They're a boy's team. They're girls basketball, they win the state championship  all the time, they're very good.  It's like they draft these people in.  And a lot of these kids that are on the team  don't look like they can pay anything.  But I really think that they supplement,  subsidize them or whatever.  But my girls, I think when my girls were here  in high school, I was paying 8,000 a year,  8,000 a year for Catholic high school.  And the college, they both went to Catholic college,  40, 50,000 a year.  And they didn't have any loans.  Well no, we didn't do that.  And they both graduated.  Oh, congratulations.  I never graduated from college.

SPEAKER_01: 0:42:39-0:42:40
 So that was my.

SPEAKER_00: 0:42:40-0:43:01
 And I never went.  I never went.  My father wanted me to go to UOP, which is now College of Pacific and New States.  Now you're still at Pacific.  And he wanted me to go to College of Pacific and I said, no, I don't think so.  I had gone through high school.  But you got a job.  Well, I got a job.  Oh, you found a job right away.  Oh, I found a job. Yeah. I found a job.

SPEAKER_02: 0:43:01-0:43:03
 As soon as you graduated?

SPEAKER_00: 0:43:03-0:44:19
 More or less.  You remember where? Yeah, personal finance.  And it was a guy that loaned money and I can remember I can still see a loan company.  I can still picture that man, but I cannot remember his name, but I remember  Marina Moya worked there and she married a Pat McHugh who went to  there. And she married a Pat McHugh who went to St. Mary's before me. I mean, he was older than me. And she married, and I can still remember the people in the office, because  she had gone away. This has nothing to do with Richard. But she had gone, she went away  for vacation or something, but she never told anybody she was gonna get married.  And she went.  I was gonna say she went off and had a baby.  No, no, no, no, no.  They did things first.  First things first in those days.  You didn't do that now.  No, no, but anyway, and she came back  and I can remember her name to this day, Marina Moya.  And she married a McHugh.  And I thought they're going  to have some beautiful babies because she was Spanish and he was Irish. And I don't  know what her kids look like, but they must be really good looking kids. But anyway, that  was where I got my first job and then that's where I did the shorthand crap.

SPEAKER_02: 0:44:19-0:44:45
 So can I ask you, Jo? I was told by your classmates that at St. Mary's there were roughly two tracks that  you could take.  If the track for those that wanted to go to college and the track for those that wanted  to do more professional things, particularly for women, job as secretaries and so on.  So what did that mean?  Like it was an issue of choosing classes, like probably choosing short-handing?  Yeah. Well, we did business classes. Oh, it was an issue of choosing classes, like probably choosing short-handing?

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:45-0:44:53
 Yeah, well, we did business classes.  Oh, you did business classes?  Yeah.  Do you remember which track you were in then?  Well, I must have been in the one that was going to go to work instead of go to college.

SPEAKER_02: 0:44:53-0:44:55
 So you took the business class.

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:55-0:44:56
 I think that's how...

SPEAKER_02: 0:44:56-0:44:58
 Did you also take typing?  Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 0:44:58-0:45:01
 Oh, you took typing?  Oh, I took typing, 40 words a minute.  Wow.

SPEAKER_02: 0:45:01-0:45:06
 Do you remember who was teaching typing?  Because Monta, you took typing, too, that's why I'm asking.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:06-0:45:10
 Who did? Oh, I did?  I don't know. I know that Mrs. Ligorio.

SPEAKER_02: 0:45:10-0:45:11
 Mrs. Ligorio.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:11-0:45:17
 Could have been her because she taught shorthand.  So she taught...  Cami, I think her name was. Cami Ligorio, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:45:17-0:45:19
 And you remember that she taught shorthand.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:19-0:45:27
 She taught shorthand. So I'm assuming that she could have taught typing too.  Then we had to take Latin and that was from Sister Collette.

SPEAKER_02: 0:45:27-0:45:29
 Sister Collette was the one that...

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:29-0:45:31
 She's not listed in that thing.

SPEAKER_02: 0:45:31-0:45:34
 Yeah, but I added it because you told me and the other people compared to it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:45:34-0:46:10
 Collette Standard, I think, was her last name.  And you know why I know that?  It's because Mr. Breer, who also went to St. Mary's, but he was way ahead of me.  He was a lot older than I was.  He went to St. Mary's and he used to take,  used to go and take Sister Colette to lunch.  And he would go back as an adult.  Yes, as an adult, yes, yes, when she was still.  And then the sisters had a place in the Santa Cruz area,  you know Johans Beach?  Around the corner, and the sisters from there used to go on vacation at this place near Santa Cruz.

SPEAKER_02: 0:46:10-0:46:12
 Did they have some sort of a convent there?

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:12-0:46:42
 It was like a hotel.  Because one time we were down there, because my dad used to take us to Santa Cruz for vacation every year.  Me and he'd take Lucille because I was an only child and I didn't have anybody else to go with so he felt sorry for Lucille so he took her too.  And it was around the corner from where we stayed, from the place you just really love.  And it was a hotel or something? Yes it was a hotel but it was run by I think the nuns.  The Dominican nuns? Yes, the Dominican nuns because that's who taught at St. Mary's

SPEAKER_02: 0:46:42-0:46:49
 and they're in the Marin County, you know, the Dominicans. Yeah, yeah, and I was told that all your teachers were Dominican, except for Mrs. Legoria.

SPEAKER_00: 0:46:49-0:46:55
 Mrs. Legoria, who taught the business stuff.  That was in the old days.  In the old days, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 0:46:55-0:47:02
 Do you remember roughly how old those nuns could have been?  Are we talking about women in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s?

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:02-0:47:06
 Sister Collette was the youngest.  Well, Sister Mary David was older.  She looked like a... She was the youngest? Well, Sister Mary David was older. She looked like a...

SPEAKER_02: 0:47:06-0:47:06
 She was the principal?

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:06-0:47:14
 She was the principal.  And she looked like, you know...  She did.  Well, she was bigger.  She was bigger anyway.

SPEAKER_02: 0:47:14-0:47:15
 Oh, she was bigger.

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:15-0:47:31
 She's a bigger lady.  And when she came in the room,  you better sit and stay because she had that look.  She was intimidating?  Yes, very intimidating to me.  And I'm sure a lot of others too.  But some of them were nice, like Sister Collette.  Sister Collette.  She got to know her a little bit better.

SPEAKER_02: 0:47:31-0:47:34
 How old could have been Sister Collette?  Sister Collette?

SPEAKER_00: 0:47:34-0:47:57
 God, maybe in her late 30s, early...  Not late 30s, late 20s, early...  Oh, okay.  So relatively young.  She was younger, but Sister David was older.  She was like the head lady.  And then I don't remember the rest of them, because I know we had to take Latin and it  was not good.

SPEAKER_02: 0:47:57-0:48:02
 You also had to take, besides Latin, did they ask you to take any other foreign language?  Do you remember?

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:02-0:48:04
 Did you take anything else?  No, I don't think they had to.

SPEAKER_02: 0:48:04-0:48:09
 So did you take like, I think they were offering French and Spanishanish. No I didn't take those. So you took latin.

SPEAKER_00: 0:48:09-0:48:59
 I took latin because I had to take latin. Do you remember for how long you had to take latin?  You take like one year of latin? I don't remember. Probably maybe two years. Two years of latin. I  would assume. But it was required. Yes it was required. No because otherwise I wouldn't have  taken it. Well I thought it was going to help me with Italian but it really didn't. No, but it's Spanish would have but I wasn't you  know thinking that. No a lot of kids here now I mean kids my kids age which are 30 and  26 they took they would take Latin as language because they thought it was easier than taking  Spanish. I didn't think it was easy. French is very hard. And actually  my girls high school taught Italian so my youngest daughter did that and made me very  happy because she can actually parlay a little bit. And St. Mary's still offers, Rose told

SPEAKER_02: 0:48:59-0:49:51
 me that they stopped offering, which language, so they're not offering French anymore they're not  offering French anymore they're still but so they don't offer offer French  they don't offer German but they are offering they're still offering Italian  oh that's good for now that's she said I don't know when the Italian teacher  Luigi's gonna retire it's unclear what's going to happen but for now at least. Was Rose Lenardini a Simonelli before she was?  Yeah, you and your sister. I went, her sister married Simonelli.  Yes, she told me, Vanna, I wish you had contacted me just a few years  before because my sister who was in the very same class was still alive but  she passed away. I just wonder how many of the class... I talked to Rose in 2013 for the first time.  And she told me that her sister had passed away  I think one or two years before.  Oh dear.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:51-0:49:55
 Yeah.  Yeah, because she had to have been, well, a year older or something.

SPEAKER_02: 0:49:55-0:49:59
 Yeah, because 1929.  Yeah, right.

SPEAKER_00: 0:49:59-0:50:05
 But I knew, Rose Lenardini, because I, for some reason,  I knew she was a Simonelli. Yeah, you're Simonelli.

SPEAKER_02: 0:50:05-0:50:28
 Yes, yeah. We women, in fact, it's a little bit of a problem with women because I looking at the yearbooks  you have a certain last name and then I go to the list that they gave me of the people that are  still alive and and so what I said about I start doing it start matching first name. Oh yeah. It's  good that you don't overlap every each of you has a different first name.  Because there were not that many of you guys to begin with.

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:28-0:50:53
 And back then, when they got married, they didn't do like I did.  I kept Joanne Bertolucci and I added Kelly.  Because Kelly was so boring.  I said, I cannot have my husband, I told him Irish.  I said, that's a terrible name. I wanted him to take my name.  He wouldn't do it.  But so, they didn't. But you know, those days, no, you're right, you're right, those days.  She keeps the Bertolucci thing.  In fact, she's the only one who doesn't have it.  You don't have it on.  She has a Bertolucci watch.

SPEAKER_02: 0:50:53-0:50:56
 Nice.  That I bought.  Nice.

SPEAKER_00: 0:50:56-0:52:04
 Yeah, that her husband bought for my husband when we were on a cruise.  And my dad always wanted a Bertolucci watch.  He wanted a Bertolucci watch.  Bertolucci watches are in Switzerland.  They're in Switzerland.  Yes, yes.  And he always wanted one, but they were expensive,  like a Rolex, you know?  Yeah.  And so they had bought my parents,  or they had bought my husband a Rolex.  When I was in Switzerland.  Yeah, yeah.  And who was in Switzerland?  They were in Switzerland.  30 years ago.  And so when we were in the Caribbean with my dad,  and it was Father's Day or something,  and my husband went and he found the Bertolucci watch.  We found it first, and then we came back to the ship  and said it was too much money, he didn't want to buy it.  So my husband went back and bought it  and he just treasured that watch.  My dad is very, sempra familia.  Well, you see the sign over there that says sempra familia.  And so was her father.  My dad too, my dad was Mancini  and money was no object. Every time youcini and money was no object.  Every time you went anywhere, money was no object.  And that's the Italians.  Not too many do that anymore.  And you know Mary, the one lady who went to her house,  Briarlee, she was a DeLucchi first.  And then I guess she divorced him.  She was telling her something about it.  Well she wrote this on the email.

SPEAKER_02: 0:52:04-0:52:19
 She had three husbands. So they're all dead now. They're all dead. She was telling her something about it. Yeah, well she wrote this on the email. Yeah, yeah.  So they're all dead now.  They're all dead.  The last one was I think last year I think.  Oh my God.  Because she mentioned that he was suffering of some degenerative disease.  Oh, that's too bad.  I think Alzheimer's.

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:19-0:52:20
 Oh, Alzheimer's. That's not good.

SPEAKER_02: 0:52:20-0:52:36
 I think the first one, she divorced from the first one.  Yeah, that's DeLuca. Yeah, and she told me that he had passed away a few years ago.  Yes, she told me that.  Yeah, okay.  And then she also added probably he drank himself to death.

default: 0:52:36-0:52:37
 Oh, really?

SPEAKER_02: 0:52:37-0:52:39
 Oh, see, well, hey, that's it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:39-0:52:55
 I remember Mary because she had these pretty blue eyes.  And yeah, she was, yeah, I mean, but see, those people,  we sort of segregated, we didn't hang in the same circles  because they were from the north area  and they all lived, you know.

SPEAKER_01: 0:52:55-0:52:56
 Near each other.

SPEAKER_00: 0:52:56-0:53:02
 Near each other and we lived, and so my friend,  my closest friend was Lucille.

SPEAKER_02: 0:53:02-0:53:10
 So Jo, did you perceive that there was,  within St. Mary and within your class, there was some  sort of social division?

SPEAKER_00: 0:53:10-0:54:21
 Not really.  I wouldn't call it that now.  So there was no discrimination?  No, no discrimination.  It was just they were from a different...  And then my mother always wanted to move.  Yeah, different.  Well, like better class, but not really because we were...  Your family was doing well.  Yeah, my dad worked his tail off  Like like I think that she's gone to Barbara Brist Boyce  She's in one of those pictures too, but she's she's been gone for a long time  She had a sister too, and I can remember them going to San Francisco to buy their school clothes  Well to me to me that, and she had this sweater  with the angora hair that I liked, you see.  And my mother, we went to a store and stopped,  Maringo's, in fact, they went to St. Mary's too,  Peter Maringo, they had a store called  Captain and Maringo in Stockton.  And then there was Smith and Lang, think was another high-class store my mother found me this lavender  sweater with the angora and then I couldn't wear it because it itched me  I mean you know I mean they came they had a little more of this is it some of

SPEAKER_02: 0:54:21-0:54:26
 your classmate who was I think was Barakat, he lived around the corner.

SPEAKER_00: 0:54:26-0:54:33
 He lived on Main Street.  Oh, he was living on Main Street?  On Main Street and Sierra Nevada.  Oh, he told me that.

SPEAKER_02: 0:54:33-0:54:35
 And then his parents owned a little store he told me of.

SPEAKER_00: 0:54:35-0:54:53
 Yes, a little store.  And then the Rishwains lived around the corner from him and they had a little store.  They were from Syria, I think.  And he had Selma  and Elma were his twin sisters. And then he had a brother too, but I can't remember the  brothers, the older brother. But he lives in Gold River. Yeah, he lives in Gold River.

SPEAKER_02: 0:54:53-0:54:59
 I went to interview him when I arrived here. I arrived on Tuesday, the first interview

SPEAKER_00: 0:54:59-0:55:06
 was with him. Yes, yes. And he's still okay? I mean mean he's got to be a year older. Yeah, he's a year older. No, he's doing very well.

SPEAKER_02: 0:55:06-0:55:25
 Oh, that's good.  Unfortunately, his wife just had a little surgery for her eyes.  Oh, her eye.  Yeah, it was something...  Not cataracts.  I think it was a little bit more severe than that.  Oh, my.  But, you know, he said that she just needs some recovery.  But we had a very nice conversation.

SPEAKER_00: 0:55:25-0:55:28
 Oh, that's good.  Yeah, they live not too far from me, you know.

SPEAKER_01: 0:55:28-0:55:31
 The Gold River is right down the street from where I live.

SPEAKER_02: 0:55:31-0:55:35
 Yeah, I saw that on the map when I was trying to figure out.  And this is the first time that I'm in this area.

SPEAKER_00: 0:55:35-0:55:36
 Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 0:55:36-0:55:51
 So I was trying to figure out how it worked.  And so I saw that you guys are not that far away.  No. And so, like, one expression that you use is 400. Did you use this expression?

SPEAKER_00: 0:55:51-0:56:31
 Yeah, the 400s, yes. The 400s. Yeah, they were a little more elite. It was a way to refer to this.  Yeah, in those days. It just meant they were in the 400 group, you know, they had more  meant they were in the 400 group. They had more money.  In fact, Brisbois' dad and my doctor, Dr. Lynch,  they lived on the same street off of Harding Way.  And it was an older neighborhood, but very nice.  Big two-story brick homes and all that.  And that's where she lived.  And I believe her father used to have something to do  with where my father worked, but he was a higher up.  You know, and, and, and.  The managerial level.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, but anyhow.

SPEAKER_02: 0:56:31-0:56:37
 So, but when you went to St. Mary's in 1943,  you didn't feel discriminated.

SPEAKER_00: 0:56:37-0:56:37
 No, no.

SPEAKER_02: 0:56:37-0:56:39

 And Charlie Rissow, I know, is dead.

SPEAKER_02: 0:58:07-0:58:09
 And then Don Peirano.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:09-0:58:21
 Don Peirano, yeah, he sat next to me in school.  And Rissow used to be, he had, when he sat next to me,  and he wasn't the class clown, Richard,  what's his name, was the class clown?

SPEAKER_02: 0:58:21-0:58:22

SPEAKER_02: 0:58:23-0:58:25
 No, not Huddleston.  No, no. Richard Wallace. Yeah, with the H. Not Huddleston. No, no Huddleston. No, no.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:25-0:58:27
 Richard Wallace.  Wallace.  Wallace.

SPEAKER_02: 0:58:27-0:58:28
 That's it.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:28-0:58:31
 Richard Wallace.  You feel like you've been at the school.

SPEAKER_02: 0:58:31-0:58:31
 I was there.

SPEAKER_00: 0:58:31-0:58:51
 Richard Wallace was the class clown.  Yes, he wasn't like Richard Montague.  He was the opposite of Richard Montague.  And then Charlie Rissow, and I think his,  remember they used to have a restaurant in Stockton called Rissow's  Yes, his mother they own that restaurant, but then I see he's passed away, too

SPEAKER_02: 0:58:51-0:58:58
 Yeah, and it's somebody who passed away recently Ed told me that it was Don Stater Stater. Yeah, I remember yes

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:00-0:59:03
 And then there was a Wayman Steele but so but

SPEAKER_02: 0:59:03-0:59:06
 Yes, yes, yes. And then there was a Wayman Steed. But, so, but, you say Wadad?

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:06-0:59:12
 Wadad.  Wadad. She's doing okay?  I don't know. I thought maybe she would have somebody with a contact.

SPEAKER_02: 0:59:12-0:59:16
 Because I wrote her in the very same way I wrote you, but I never heard back from her.

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:16-0:59:19
 Yeah, and then her friend, good friend, was Genevieve Peters.

SPEAKER_02: 0:59:19-0:59:20
 Peters.

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:20-0:59:40
 And she's still a Peters. Wadad?  Yeah, I wrote her too. And they used to have a little store near the St. Mary's High School.  Her parents had a store.  I guess that's what they did when they came.  They had little stores.  They were Syrian and that was their business.

SPEAKER_02: 0:59:40-0:59:47
 So I wrote both of them and unfortunately you don't hear from from them. Yeah. You know, sometimes I get the letters back and that's the sign.

SPEAKER_00: 0:59:47-1:00:50
 Okay.  This is Genevieve Peters.  This is my friend Lucille, who passed away a couple of years ago.  There's Alma.  No, that's not Alma.  Alma's got her hand in front of her face.  And that's my dad in the back.  And that looks like Lucille Elliot? No, Carmen Silva.  That's Carmen Silva. She passed away. She was a good friend of Alma Machina.  And she passed away. We were at Pinecrest at our school.  You know, our high school. What do you call when they take you away? When you go on these trips.  It was a school trip? School trip. For the winter?  Field trip.  Field trip, yeah.  We went to Pinecrest.  I think it was a senior trip or something.  And that's where we went.  It's going, you know, Sonora?  You go up further up Sonora.  And there was Pinecrest Lake and that's where we used to, in fact, we used to go up there  too because my mother's neighbor, Frasera, had a cabin up there.  Only girls trek, no boys.  No, there was boys there too.

SPEAKER_02: 1:00:50-1:00:58
 I think on the yearbooks, you see some, because some of the random pictures on the yearbooks,  they look like pictures that you took during those trips.  Yeah.  You see that you guys are playing.

SPEAKER_00: 1:00:58-1:00:59
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:00:59-1:01:01
 You are on the mountains and so on.

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:01-1:01:05
 I decided to take some snow home and I put it in a coke bottle

SPEAKER_02: 1:01:11-1:01:15
 and I put it in the bus and it started melting. I can still remember that.

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:21-1:01:30
 Anyways. So, Jo, do you remember if those trips were like optional, that is, were just for the people that want to go or the entire school? Well, no, I think it was just like this was a senior trip.  So it would be, I think, just the seniors.  Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:01:30-1:01:32
 But it was an optional activity?

SPEAKER_00: 1:01:32-1:01:42
 You know, I guess if you wanted to...  I guess maybe you had to go, I don't know.  Because otherwise you went to school that day, I would assume.

SPEAKER_02: 1:01:42-1:02:01
 Talking about something that you have to do or not to do,  so do you remember if there were,  so there were people at St. Mary's that were non-Catholic.  Richard was one of them, and maybe there were others too.  Do you remember if they were there to stay in class  during religion, you know, the religion class?

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:01-1:02:03
 I don't think they took the religion class.

SPEAKER_02: 1:02:03-1:02:04
 Oh, they didn't?

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:04-1:02:11
 Maybe they didn't. You don't think so? Well, I don't know, maybe they religion class. Oh, they didn't? Maybe they didn't.  You don't think so?  Well, I don't know.  Kids in St. Francis, if you're not Catholic, you can be anything.  You still have to go to the classes.  Oh, really?  See, I can't say because I don't remember.

SPEAKER_02: 1:02:11-1:02:21
 Because I wonder if they were either staying in class anyway or go to the study hall or  something.

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:21-1:02:26
 You know, it's possible, but I can't remember that specific thing.

SPEAKER_02: 1:02:26-1:02:45
 And can I ask you, like, when you were at St. Mary's,  was there something, because I was going through the old issue of the kettle,  and a couple of times they were making reference to  something that was a sort of welcoming for freshmen,  that they called the initiation?

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:45-1:02:53
 Yeah.  Freshmen initiation.  Yeah, but I don't remember.  Okay.  Well, they probably did something for them, but I don't remember what.

SPEAKER_02: 1:02:53-1:02:56
 Was there some sort of like welcoming event?

SPEAKER_00: 1:02:56-1:02:58
 I don't remember exactly because it's too far back.

SPEAKER_01: 1:02:58-1:03:02
 You don't remember your freshman year going there and you get all excited?

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:02-1:03:18
 No, no.  You're nervous?  No, you got to remember, I was younger than the rest of them.  And I was sort of, you know, a little, I was sort of behind.  I wasn't like, I'm not outgoing like I am now.  I was very introverted.  We were more on the shy side.  Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:03:18-1:03:31
 And so do you remember the atmosphere in class?  Like when the nuns would teach, was the atmosphere relaxed? Was the atmosphere  tense because it was intimidating? Were the kids good? Were they making noise?

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:31-1:03:37
 Some were. Some were good and some, like I say, like Richard and even Charlie Richo.

SPEAKER_02: 1:03:37-1:03:38
 You mean Richard Wallace?

SPEAKER_00: 1:03:39-1:04:18
 No, yeah, Richard Wallace.  Not Richard Montague.  No, not Richard Montague. Richard Montague usedague, if I remember, used to sit in the back of one of my classes,  and he was very quiet.  He was studious, you know.  But Richard Wallace was not.  And Charlie Rissell was sort of outgoing too,  and I can remember he had,  I don't know who bought it for him,  but he had a Chevrolet 19,  oh, Dad would have liked it. I can't remember the year.  57?  No.  47.  Well, let's see, we were in school.  44, 45, 46.  Maybe it was 47.  I don't know.  It was a two-door Chevrolet, black.  And he...

SPEAKER_02: 1:04:18-1:04:19
 He was driving to school?

SPEAKER_00: 1:04:19-1:05:03
 Well, he was old enough after he got to be...  He had a car, though.  He had a car after he... Well, he got old enough after he got to be, you know, I mean, he could drive. He had a car, though. He had a car after he, well, he got his license, yeah,  because that would have been,  he got his license at 16, I guess, or 17,  and he could drive to school.  And everybody used to go out,  in fact, I had pictures of,  and I don't know where they are now,  but the girls, you know, sitting on the car.  Yeah, I mean, he had, he was,  and then he used to show, he had Argyle socks.  You remember the days when they had Argyle socks?  You know what Argyle are?  They're the ones that are diamond like.  They're like diamond shaped.  In those days, those were the fancy ones.  He used to sit next to me and pull his leg  and show off his socks.  He had money.  Now that family was in the 400.

SPEAKER_02: 1:05:03-1:05:05
 Oh, he was in the 400, well, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 1:05:05-1:05:07
 Well, his mother owned the restaurant.

SPEAKER_02: 1:05:07-1:05:08
 Oh, I see.

SPEAKER_00: 1:05:08-1:05:19
 But anyhow, he was a Risto,  so he was part Italian anyway, so anyhow.  But I mean, things like that I remember.  Yeah, he was a show-off, yeah.  So he might not have been studious.

SPEAKER_01: 1:05:19-1:05:20
 Uh-huh, probably.

SPEAKER_00: 1:05:20-1:05:44
 He graduated, but I don't know what happened to him.  Didn't the nuns have you misbehave?  Oh yeah, they...  I remember here when I went to grad school, they hit you with the ruler.  Well, my son too.  And the ruler, my son.  My son was not studious.  Sure they did that.  Oh yeah, no, they didn't hit you with the...  I don't remember anybody...  That was high school, maybe grammar school,  but I don't think high school, I don't think they did that.  They put you in your place.

SPEAKER_02: 1:05:44-1:05:49
 So did they send people, would they send people  to people that were misbehaving to the principal?

SPEAKER_00: 1:05:49-1:05:55
 They probably would, but I don't remember that happening.  But they used to reprimand them, you know, when they were.

SPEAKER_02: 1:05:55-1:06:02
 But do you remember if you were feeling,  if you felt scared to be at that place?  No.  Or you felt comfortable in class?

SPEAKER_00: 1:06:02-1:06:10
 No, I was, like I say, I was more intimidated because it was me, but most of those other kids...  They were not particularly...  No, I don't think so, no.

SPEAKER_02: 1:06:10-1:06:11
 So they were...

SPEAKER_00: 1:06:12-1:06:14
 It took me a while, you know.

SPEAKER_02: 1:06:14-1:06:30
 I was just trying to get a sense of like how...  Strict.  Yeah, how strict and how... what kind of atmosphere was the atmosphere in class?  You know, you heard stories of certain schools, and particularly nuns, where the atmosphere  is really super, super rigid and scary.  No, they wanted you to learn.

SPEAKER_00: 1:06:30-1:07:05
 And the only time it was scary is when Sister David came in.  Because she looked the part.  I mean, she looked like, what's the guy on the program?  Schultz.  Schultz, see, that's why I said, that's why.  That's what Mark used to call me.  It's a TV show, a long time ago,  about the Nazis and this guy was this big old guy  and they called him, he's kind of like a mill, though.  She was a big lady, too, but she was very strict.  But I don't remember being that intimidated,  and I did my work, so you know.

SPEAKER_02: 1:07:05-1:07:13
 Yeah, and you know.  So, and Jo, do you remember if Sister David taught any class  or she was just the principal?  Have you ever had her as a teacher?

SPEAKER_00: 1:07:13-1:07:21
 I don't remember, but I know she used to come in the class  at some time, but I don't remember  if I had a class with her or not.  The only one I really remember is Sister Collette.

SPEAKER_02: 1:07:21-1:07:28
 And how was she as a teacher?  Sister Collette?  Sister Collette, yeah. She was good. And? Sister Collette? Sister Collette, yeah.  She was good.  She was good?  Yeah.  And you said that she was teaching?

SPEAKER_00: 1:07:28-1:07:28
 She was more.

SPEAKER_02: 1:07:28-1:07:31
 What was she teaching you?

SPEAKER_00: 1:07:31-1:07:48
 What did she teach you?  I don't remember.  I know I took Latin, but I know who taught me business,  because that was Mrs. Ligorio.  That was Mrs. Ligorio.  Yes.  And I don't remember who taught the rest.  I don't remember the other ones that taught.  I don't remember what she taught.  But I know that she was a nice teacher.  She was a nice teacher, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 1:07:48-1:08:07
 And so, Jo, did you guys have like,  how was your day at school structure?  You start, let's say, around 8.30.  And then would you have lunch?  Was there any break between lunch  and the beginning of the morning and lunch?  Or you were straight, like you had to go? Was there any break between lunch, the beginning of the morning and lunch?  Or you were straight, like you had to go...

SPEAKER_00: 1:08:07-1:08:17
 Probably. You know, I don't remember that part at all, as far as time.  I mean, we had so many classes in the morning and then so many classes in the afternoon.

SPEAKER_02: 1:08:17-1:08:18
 But there was a lunch break, you remember that?

SPEAKER_00: 1:08:18-1:08:19
 Oh yeah, I know there was a lunch break.

SPEAKER_02: 1:08:19-1:08:21
 Would people eat at school or they would go home to eat?

SPEAKER_00: 1:08:21-1:08:24
 Well, I guess the people that lived close could go home. I couldn't go home.

SPEAKER_02: 1:08:24-1:08:26
 So you could leave the school if you wanted more lunch? I think so, yeah. But you would bring home to eat? Well, I guess the people that lived close could go home. I couldn't go home. So you could leave the school if you wanted more lunch.

SPEAKER_00: 1:08:26-1:08:27
 I think so, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:08:27-1:08:28
 But you would bring your own food?

SPEAKER_00: 1:08:28-1:08:41
 I would bring our own lunch,  and then I don't remember if,  they must have had a cafeteria in there,  but I think we used to bring our lunch.  Gnocchi and red beans.  Oh yeah, right, oh yeah.  Her mother made very good gnocchi.  Yes.  Ah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:08:41-1:08:43
 Ah, yeah.  Ah, delicious.

SPEAKER_00: 1:08:43-1:08:49
 Yeah, anyways. I see, I see.  But that part, I don't remember the structure part.

SPEAKER_02: 1:08:49-1:08:57
 So did you guys have like, sometimes schools have things like assemblies, gatherings.  So did you have any of those?

SPEAKER_00: 1:08:57-1:09:04
 Yeah, we did.  Because I think, what's her name, remembered Richard playing for something.

SPEAKER_02: 1:09:04-1:11:14
 Yeah, Mary. She told me, because I don't remember it. But no, we had that. I remember Richard playing for something.  She told me, because I don't remember it, but no, we had that.  Actually, they told me this funny anecdote,  which actually is also mentioned in  When He Showed the Cattle, so it's interesting.  So I think probably it was your junior year,  from what I've been able to reconstruct  to your junior year.  They told me that Sister David used to come to the assembly and because  there were nuns at the assembly, so you guys were left alone, is it correct?  So Sister David would arrive and would ask Richard Montague to play.  And Richard would start playing classical music as usual, so he must have learned.  And I heard, I found a classmate of his from elementary school and she told me from like third or fourth grade she told me that she was  already playing for the school events so he must have started very very young.  So by the time he was there Sister David realized that he was good at playing the  piano and so would ask Clay and Richard would play some classical thing. At that  assembly the football team with Ed went next to him and he said,  Richard. Because, you know, the way your classmates...  There were two different people there. Yes, the way your classmates described it,  like, you know, Sister David was saying Richard, and he would start playing classical music,  this was Bernice, and all of us like, oh, oh, oh, yes.  So that day, the football team with their captain, captain Ed went next to Richard and said,  Richard can you play some boogie woogie?  Boogie woogie.  Boogie woogie.  And so Bernice remembered this very well and said, Ivano, I remember this very clearly.  He was there playing, he was always very concentrated when he was playing and then he turned towards and Ed confirms he turned towards us he looked at us  he smiled and he went back and he turned the classical piece that he was playing he turned  that into boogie woogie and we all got wild because it was so like wow and so I like the  way Mary summarized that and said well Iv, Ivano, up to that point,  we thought that Richard was our nerd.  You know, each class has a nerd, he is the nerd.  But then after that, we were very proud  because now we have the coolest nerd in the school

SPEAKER_01: 1:11:14-1:11:16
 because he could play the boogie woogie.

SPEAKER_02: 1:11:16-1:11:19
 And he wasn't afraid to do it.  No, no, no.

SPEAKER_00: 1:11:19-1:11:19
 Well, and he could do it.

SPEAKER_02: 1:11:19-1:12:26
 He could do it.  Clearly, like we know, I mean,  I already knew that he was a gifted pianist  and organist because he could have had a career in that.  In fact, during all the time in graduate school at Berkeley, he had a double life.  So he was hired as a graduate student in teaching mathematics at Berkeley, but every year he  had a full-time job as the music master in every year change congregation  to get more money.  Every year was paid more.  So by the end, by 1954, Berkeley was paying him $150 a month to be a graduate student  and the Presbyterian Church was paying him $170 a month to be the master of music. So he was taking care of the Sunday service  and plus organizing concerts once a month  and directing the choir and so on.  In fact, there is a picture in which he, I believe,  and more than one classmate of yours agree with me  that this is a picture of the choir.  Unfortunately, it's a very low.  Yeah, he used to play the organ.  And this probably is him.

SPEAKER_00: 1:12:26-1:12:28
 Oh yeah, that's him. I can tell by the back of his head.

SPEAKER_02: 1:12:28-1:12:32
 Do you agree?  Do you agree? Because I have that intuition.

SPEAKER_00: 1:12:32-1:12:38
 Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure  that's him because  it just looks like

SPEAKER_02: 1:12:38-1:12:42
 the cut. Yeah, he had a very peculiar cut.  It was balding here a little bit.

SPEAKER_00: 1:12:42-1:12:46
 Well, that I don't remember, but I know that  that looks like him.

SPEAKER_02: 1:12:46-1:13:19
 I know that he was in charge of the senior choir.  So he really was a gifted musician.  And then when he went to UCLA, for a little bit he played more and then he just focused  on the academic job.  But people remember because he kept playing for friends.  And people that I interviewed remember Silvani.  It was kind of amazing because  he could play a very difficult piece on the piano and then maybe they were friends, he would play,  he had lots of African-American friends, and maybe he would play some like traditional  African-American song on the piano. And then he could switch and go back to do mathematics.

SPEAKER_00: 1:13:19-1:13:23
 Like this. He could totally switch from...  No, yeah, he was...

SPEAKER_02: 1:13:23-1:13:28
 The kind of capacity of like switching from one task to another without any problem. He had to be brilliant. Oh, he was... The kind of capacity of switching from one task to another without any problem.

SPEAKER_01: 1:13:28-1:13:30
 He had to be brilliant.

SPEAKER_02: 1:13:30-1:14:35
 Actually, I mean, there is not a direct correlation, but it's something related to the brain.  I got a copy of, since it was a murder, and they did an autopsy.  So I got a copy of the autopsy.  Wow.  And you look at the coroner, you know when they do an autopsy  They need to measure everything. Oh, yeah everything. Yeah, so they measure his brain and Richard you may you may confirm that  But from what I saw Richard was not a big guy. No  Brain five six. Yeah, it was not that so the coroner rides, you know weighs everything. I think looks normal brain  the brain is a  Unusually Big everything looks normal. Brain. The brain is unusually big. It weighs, you know, 1,520 grams. And I said, okay, so way above, in the right, way above average. I said, okay,  let me go and check what the average is. The average of a human brain is 1,350 grams. So Richard's brain was almost 200 grams above  the average. And it's not like, oh, he had a big body. No, no, no.

SPEAKER_00: 1:14:35-1:14:53
 No, he was not. And he was not athletic looking either, because I'm sure that Ed Barakat would  say the same thing. He didn't do sports.  No, but he was very smart.  Because he was.  He was different.  I mean, he was.  I mean, I played basketball there.  I was on the basketball team.

SPEAKER_02: 1:14:53-1:14:56
 So how important was sports at St. Mary's?  Was it like?

SPEAKER_00: 1:14:56-1:14:57
 Yeah, oh yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:14:57-1:14:58
 Was it very important?

SPEAKER_00: 1:14:58-1:15:21
 You know, I think it got more important when  they moved to the other building,  because they were very good.  Their football team and their basketball team.  And when we played, I don't remember  we played intramural or not,  but I know I played basketball with a group of girls.  But it got to be quite, when we were there,  it was getting there, I guess.  But the boys, they had a good team.

SPEAKER_02: 1:15:21-1:15:28
 Yeah, Ed was telling me.  Still, it was like optional. You were not required to do sports, is that correct? You know, we had to...

SPEAKER_00: 1:15:28-1:15:39
 Wait a minute. Well, wait a minute. I had to do... Don't you have to do physical education? Yes, we did physical ed.  Because I had to wear those stupid little dumb-looking shorts. I see. I don't know where the shorts are.

SPEAKER_02: 1:15:39-1:15:48
 I don't think it's in the... And you were required to do that? Yeah. But do you know if that counted as a class?

SPEAKER_00: 1:15:48-1:15:49
 That I don't remember.

SPEAKER_02: 1:15:49-1:15:56
 Because I was curious about this fact,  because the only thing that I have are Richard's transcripts.  So I can see all the classes you took.

SPEAKER_00: 1:15:56-1:15:58
 I wonder.  I don't think he.

SPEAKER_02: 1:15:58-1:16:26
 But nowhere was mentioned physical education.  But now what I was wondering is, is it  because physical education was not  listed as one of the classes? Or is it because it got an exemption, you  know, sometimes it gets an exemption for whatever reason. Because I know that this is, what  happened is that poor Richard, once he graduated, he didn't move to Berkeley right away, probably  was too young because he graduated, he was not even 17. Like, you know, around the, you would have turned 17 in September,

SPEAKER_01: 1:16:26-1:16:28
 you got graduated in June.

SPEAKER_02: 1:16:28-1:16:58
 So probably, that's my assumption,  the parents would say, look,  you want to go to Berkeley, I understand,  but let's wait one more year when you are 18.  So why don't you start going to Stockton Junior College?  So for one year, from 1947 to 1948,  he went to Stockton Junior College.  And I managed to get a copy of those transcripts when he was there.  Poor Richard.  Because he had to take, I mean, physical education, not just that, social dance.

SPEAKER_00: 1:16:58-1:16:59
 Social dance?

SPEAKER_02: 1:16:59-1:17:09
 Social dance.  Then there are classes like men's hygiene.  Oh, yes.  I don't want to think about it.

SPEAKER_01: 1:17:09-1:17:10
 Oh, my goodness.

SPEAKER_02: 1:17:10-1:17:41
 Now, all the classes that were clearly classes where you had to study, you see A, A, A, A.  Then you go, oh, and then there was swimming, okay?  Oh, God.  Swimming, social dance, and physical education.  Okay, then you see this disaster.  I think in swimming he managed to get B minus.  Oh, not too bad.  Although, no, no, no.  Physical education, sorry.  Physical education he got C. Oh dear.  Okay.  Swimming he got C. And then there was the third one.  Oh, social dance he got B minus.

SPEAKER_00: 1:17:41-1:17:43
 Oh, that's because of the piano.

SPEAKER_02: 1:17:43-1:18:07
 Yeah, no. So social dance he got B minus. Oh, that's because of the piano. And so you see the following semester he managed, he changes the code of the physical education  class.  I went to check for the catalogs and why did he change the physical education?  That's the special physical education for people with physical impairment.  He managed to get the doctor something certificate.  And now in that class he managed to go from C to B.  Oh my gosh.

SPEAKER_00: 1:18:07-1:18:37
 Oh, he moved up.  Oh my gosh, that's funny.  Well, you know, I could not see.  But you know what?  That's just normal.  There's people that have your talent in that area.  No, but you saw the picture of Richard when he went to school.  He didn't dress like a normal guy.  You didn't see the picture?  No.  Well, look at it.  There he is. Yeah, you immediately see the contrast. Well, look at it. There he is.  Yeah, you immediately see the contrast.  Now, he's dressed.  Wait a minute.  Where your thumb is.  The very first guy.  Now, you look at him, how he's dressed.  Going to high school.  You didn't have a uniform?

SPEAKER_02: 1:18:37-1:18:42
 No, they didn't.  We didn't have to have a uniform.  It was one of, I think you guys were the only high school girls

SPEAKER_00: 1:18:42-1:18:43
 that didn't integrate in high school.

SPEAKER_02: 1:18:43-1:18:45
 Integrate high school, you're right.

SPEAKER_00: 1:18:45-1:19:04
 Because we came here and then we had girls high school and like Jesuit. We have Jesuit, right?  Yeah, we have the Jesuit.  Yeah, we have the Jesuit.  It's all boys.  I'm not happy with the Jesuit.  Oh, come on now. Just let him go.  Sorry.  No, I can't let him go.  All right, so he's got a nice cardigan on.  Yeah, yeah.  But you see, he's dressed like Nonu Frank.  Yeah, yeah.  He dressed like my father.

SPEAKER_02: 1:19:04-1:19:05
 Yeah, that's him. Oh, yeah. He He dressed like my father. Yeah, that's him.

SPEAKER_00: 1:19:05-1:19:18
 Oh, yeah.  He's dressed like my father.  He's an old soul in a young body.  You know what?  I really, I, no, I've never seen him.  I didn't see the picture of him on Wikipedia.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you saw that.  No.  But his hair is different.  Yeah, it is.  I know.

SPEAKER_02: 1:19:18-1:19:23
 But you look at him compared to the other boys.  Wow.

SPEAKER_00: 1:19:23-1:19:42
 Oh, my gosh.  You could tell, by the way, he was a genius. Well, yeah. No, he's just a smart friend You see, yeah. Wow. See? Oh my gosh. You could tell by the way he was a genius.  Well yeah, no.  No, true, I mean we didn't call him a genius then,  but you knew he was different.  Well he was smart.  Smart, yeah.  He's very smart.  Well he went to Berserkly, that's what I call that.  I go back to the Patty Hearst days, see?  So that's why I call it Berserk,  and we're from San Francisco.

SPEAKER_02: 1:19:42-1:20:27
 And actually, he managed to,  so once he moved to Berkeley, it's true that  he had taken a few classes at Stockton Junior College, but not that much relevant.  So initially he wanted to major in journalism at Stockton Junior College.  He moves to Berkeley, and for a reason that I don't know, he had decided to change major.  Now he chose philosophy right away.  Wow.  And in two years, I mean, in two years he took like 34 classes.  I mean, I don't know how that happened.  And keep in mind that he was working full time as organ, like the music director.  And so he managed to take all A's, except in the required, at that time I was told that  you had to take ROTC classes.

SPEAKER_00: 1:20:27-1:20:28
 Oh yes.

SPEAKER_02: 1:20:28-1:20:29
 And they were required.

SPEAKER_00: 1:20:29-1:20:30
 Yes, yes, to go to the service.

SPEAKER_02: 1:20:30-1:20:39
 So you take two years of those.  He must have found a way to skip the second year because he took them the first year and  they got like B, I think, for those classes.  But he did get a B.

SPEAKER_00: 1:20:39-1:20:41
 He got a B.  Yeah, B.

SPEAKER_02: 1:20:41-1:20:47
 But all the others are A's.  And then the second year he was exempted again.  They must have managed to do it.

SPEAKER_01: 1:20:47-1:20:49
 This is not for you.

SPEAKER_02: 1:20:49-1:20:51
 Yes, clearly.  Go away.

SPEAKER_01: 1:20:51-1:20:52
 Oh dear.

SPEAKER_02: 1:20:52-1:22:21
 So in two years, he got his BA in philosophy.  Then he did an MA in mathematics in three years.  And then he started his PhD.  It initially had to be philosophy and mathematics at the same time.  But then, two years within his PhD, UCLA hired him.  So in 1955, he moved to Los Angeles and it took him one year to finish his dissertation  when he was already teaching in Los Angeles.  And then it took him six, seven years and he became a full professor.  And he was teaching philosophy.  He was in the philosophy department teaching logic, intro to philosophy, and semantics,  and a variety of classes related to his field of studies.  And he became, pretty soon he became one of the most important professors in the philosophy department and  definitely among the most important ones he was the youngest because there were some important  names in the philosophy department but these were people that could have been his father.  And by the time Richard died, he was 40, he had the highest salary in the philosophy department  despite the fact that there were colleagues of his that were like, he was 40, he had the highest salary in the philosophy department.  Despite the fact that there were colleagues of his that were like, he was 40 and they  were 60.  Oh my gosh.  But he had gotten, like the year before he had gotten five different offers from five  different universities.  So it was a very successful, and on top of being a successful professor, he was a successful  businessman.

SPEAKER_00: 1:22:21-1:22:25
 Yeah, I know.  I saw in that paper that he was in real estate or

SPEAKER_02: 1:22:25-1:23:09
 something. Yeah, and his colleagues at UCLA didn't know anything. They knew that he was  wealthy. He was probably very quiet. Because, well, he had many lives and he kept those  lives separate. This capacity, the one that you saw playing and jumping from mathematics  to playing, that's something that he kept for all his life. So he could, like, he had  a life as a very successful professor at UCLA, mentor, advisor,  teacher.  And then he had a life, it looks like he had a life as a real estate investor, stock market  investor.  He made enough money that he bought a house.  For sure I know that he had at least three pieces of real estate property.  One was the cottage not too far away from UCLA  where he first lived.  And then he bought this beautiful house  on Mulholland Drive, which is another thing.

SPEAKER_00: 1:23:09-1:23:12
 Oh yeah, Mulholland, yeah, where all the stars are.

SPEAKER_02: 1:23:12-1:23:18
 On this beautiful cul-de-sac, which was really,  unfortunately the house was bought in 2010.

SPEAKER_00: 1:23:18-1:23:21
 And somebody knocked it down or something.

SPEAKER_02: 1:23:21-1:23:26
 So they spent $4 million to buy the house,  to build the $ million dollars mansion.

SPEAKER_00: 1:23:26-1:23:30
 Oh my god.  It's nuts. It's nuts. The real estate market.

SPEAKER_02: 1:23:30-1:24:15
 Oh what a shame. So you couldn't see.  But I was lucky enough that when I talked to the detective, the police had taken pictures of the house.  Oh they had.  So I have an idea what the house looked like outside. I have an idea of like you know some of the main features and the little cottage still exists so I went the new owners were  nice enough. The environment hasn't changed much so I could have an idea.  And then pictures of before the renovation what it looked like and then they owned a  small apartment complex, 10 apartments in the San Fernando Valley right down  the New Holland  Drive, and that's where the parents lived.  So the parents lived in one apartment and managed the remainder of the...  So it would be like 10 minutes drive down the hill to from...

SPEAKER_00: 1:24:15-1:24:18
 Yeah.  Well, what happened to his estate then?

SPEAKER_02: 1:24:18-1:24:19
 Oh, that would have been horrible.

SPEAKER_00: 1:24:19-1:24:20
 Because he had nobody.

SPEAKER_02: 1:24:20-1:24:22
 It's a sad story.  He had nobody.

SPEAKER_00: 1:24:22-1:24:23
 That would be horrible.

SPEAKER_02: 1:24:23-1:24:28
 So he died and the parents inherited everything.

SPEAKER_00: 1:24:28-1:24:31
 Yeah, but they didn't have anybody else, right?

SPEAKER_02: 1:24:31-1:25:14
 Well, they had a family, relatives, you can think of.  Oh, oh.  But it didn't go that way.  So the father died first. He was already sick.  So the mother inherited everything.  So we are now 1973, the mother is Lorraine, in 1973 she was 79.  So Lorraine was born in 1894 and so now it's 1973.  So she was 79.  Now since the father was sick, there was a doctor that was taking care of him.  And the doctor started taking care of her too, taking her to dinner, to the movies,

SPEAKER_00: 1:25:14-1:25:21
 to concerts.  He was taking care of her.  Yeah.  I got it figured out.  So he ended up...

SPEAKER_02: 1:25:21-1:25:44
 By the time...  So then at a certain point, he also became her doctor.  And so the reason...  The way I know this is because I found a relative who was married with the daughter of Lorraine's  cousin.  Oh, yeah.  And you remember that they drove his wife's mother to Los Angeles from Lompoc to visit

SPEAKER_00: 1:25:44-1:25:45
 her. Oh, okay. To visit to visit her. Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_02: 1:25:45-1:26:04
 To visit Aunt Lorraine.  Okay.  Okay.  So they also did that when Richard was still alive, so he remembered to have visited the  beautiful house on Moana Drive.  And that day, first they went to the apartment where the parents were living, and how proud  the mother was.  Let's go and see the house.  Richard bought a very nice house.  Yes.

SPEAKER_00: 1:26:04-1:26:06
 She was very proud.

SPEAKER_02: 1:26:06-1:26:10
 So they went there, Richard was waiting for them,  he played the piano.

SPEAKER_00: 1:26:10-1:26:23
 Oh, wow, wonderful.  But Ivano, think about it.  That house picture we saw, where they lived.  That woman is very, very good, the Mohalan Drive.  No wonder, she probably was so proud that he was successful.

SPEAKER_02: 1:26:23-1:27:04
 And there was this desire, probably Richard was also, I mean, Lorraine, from what I've  been able to gather, was a smart woman who never pursued a career on her own.  Officially she was an housewife.  But my impression was she was really the driving force of the family because I found these  letters that she wrote when Richard moved to UCLA.  So it was the first time that they were separated.  They didn't go to UCLA right away, to Los Angeles right away.  They waited four years, and then from Oakland, they moved to Los Angeles.  In those years, she wrote these letters, especially at the very beginning.  These letters were like full, you know, other things like that you need to eat and so on,  but also very precise business suggestions, like you should look into the real estate.  Don't waste money with rent.  Dad and I can help you.

SPEAKER_00: 1:27:04-1:27:06
 You should buy right away.  The market is going well.

SPEAKER_02: 1:27:06-1:27:16
 That's an investment.  Dad and I can come and look at the house.  Dad, look at the house.  We are not very convinced.  Probably that's not a good investment.  So the woman was business oriented.

SPEAKER_01: 1:27:16-1:27:19
 Yes.  Very driven in that sense.  Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:27:19-1:27:25
 So now we arrive.  She loses everything.  She loses her beloved son.  She loses her husband,

SPEAKER_00: 1:27:25-1:27:29
 and this doctor now is taking care of her.

SPEAKER_02: 1:27:29-1:27:54
 And so what I heard from this side of the family is that at a certain point, you know,  the cousin was calling Aunt Lorraine to tell us that, and he says, you know, I just talked  to Aunt Lorraine about what's happening to her.  I talked to her on the phone and she says, oh, her name was Helen.  Oh, Helen, I'm in love.  I love him.  She was 81, 80, 81 at that point.  And how old was the doctor?  The doctor, I think, was like 57.

SPEAKER_01: 1:27:54-1:27:58
 Oh, my goodness.  OK, she, yeah, OK.

SPEAKER_02: 1:27:58-1:28:19
 So what happened is that she, and then at a certain point, it looked like she had to,  but it's unclear how necessary it was, she had some like surgery because, anyway, so she got sick and they went to see her because  she was doing poorly.  Yeah.  And initially the doctor didn't want to let her see her at the hospital.  They had to hire a lawyer to be able to act.

SPEAKER_00: 1:28:19-1:28:21
 He was keeping people, his family, terrible.

SPEAKER_02: 1:28:21-1:28:36
 So finally she dies and when they open the will, well the  will you know allocates a certain amount of money to the relatives but in the  meantime most of her property has been transferred. She had given him, she had

SPEAKER_00: 1:28:36-1:28:45
 transferred the property. What a shame. And they were not married? No. Oh they weren't married.  They never did. Like donations. Yeah, exactly, they weren't married. She got an attorney to call in.

SPEAKER_02: 1:28:45-1:28:55
 Like donations.  Yeah, exactly.  He had a dear friend who was an attorney.  Oh, okay.  They basically made this exchange of ownership before, you know, and she was officially able  to understand, so it's not that she was incapacitated.

SPEAKER_00: 1:28:55-1:28:56
 Oh.

SPEAKER_02: 1:28:56-1:29:08
 So there's no documentation.  So they went on for a legal suit, and then a certain body disappeared in Canada, okay?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  And then he came back.  There was this legal suit.  They got some little money, but most of the money was already gone.  He went to the attorneys.

SPEAKER_00: 1:29:08-1:29:12
 Oh, that's terrible.  My only hope is that, given all this, given the fact that Richard was already dead, the  husband was dead, I only hope that she believed until the very end.  At least she was happy that this man really cared for her and he was not doing that for

SPEAKER_02: 1:29:12-1:29:23
 her money.  I really hope that it was that.  Yeah, well, she'll know now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know.  Maybe it's that.  Maybe it's that.  Maybe it's that.  Maybe it's that.  Maybe it's that.  Maybe it's that.  Maybe it's that.

SPEAKER_00: 1:29:23-1:29:24
 Maybe it's that.

SPEAKER_02: 1:29:24-1:29:26
 Maybe it's that. Maybe it's that. Maybe it was not doing that for her money. I really hope that was there.

SPEAKER_00: 1:29:26-1:29:27
 She'll know now.

SPEAKER_02: 1:29:27-1:29:30
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know.  Maybe it's their following in.

SPEAKER_00: 1:29:30-1:29:36
 That's terrible, yes.  Terrible, I know.  That's terrible. I mean the whole thing is not good.  It's kind of sad, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:29:36-1:29:51
 Very sad.  Not good at all.  Imagine this poor woman that has done everything possible for her son.  The son dies and dies in that way.  Oh, that terrible. And then, you know then she loses her husband, her following here,  and she's there in Los Angeles with all this money,  but nothing.

SPEAKER_00: 1:29:51-1:29:54
 Nothing.  Nothing at all.  There's no family.

SPEAKER_02: 1:29:54-1:30:01
 There's nothing.  I mean, like, there's no family.  There's nobody.  Like, her with only, so I can imagine this man.

SPEAKER_00: 1:30:01-1:30:09
 I'm sure he took advantage.  I'm sorry, but he took advantage of the situation to be friendly.  Did she know how he died, you think?  Oh, yeah, she had.

SPEAKER_02: 1:30:09-1:30:58
 She did.  She must have.  So, the reason why I, okay.  So my understanding is that within that family, there was, so they adored Richard.  Richard was, for them, was like, especially I think for for the mother must have been the realization of her dream. Yes. Like being smart, successful,  wealthy, and different. Yeah. You know look he's not like the others. That's true.  And like as we say in Italian I mean doesn't matter how ugly you are there's  this proverb that says actually it's from Naples. Yeah. Let me tell you in a poem first. Yeah, well, that's my grandma.  Oh, that's nice.  Ogni scarrafone bella mamma soia.  So, that's dialect.  Every, every cockroach is beautiful to its own mother.

SPEAKER_00: 1:30:58-1:31:01
 To its own mother. That's very true. That's true. That's true.

SPEAKER_02: 1:31:01-1:31:08
 So, for Lorraine, I think Richard was really like the dream, you know, and then received...

SPEAKER_00: 1:31:08-1:31:10
 My Naples grandma.

SPEAKER_02: 1:31:10-1:31:11
 Wow!

SPEAKER_00: 1:31:11-1:31:12
 That's her third husband.

SPEAKER_02: 1:31:12-1:31:14
 So she's the one that came here?

SPEAKER_00: 1:31:14-1:31:20
 She's the one... no, no, no, no, no, that's my mother's mother.  She's from Naples.

SPEAKER_02: 1:31:20-1:31:22
 She's from Naples. Do you know her last name?

SPEAKER_00: 1:31:22-1:31:27
 Yes. Well, her original last name was Nardoza.

SPEAKER_02: 1:31:27-1:31:29
 Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 1:31:29-1:31:31
 Nardoza. Then she married...

SPEAKER_02: 1:31:31-1:31:33
 Somebody from Naples?

SPEAKER_00: 1:31:33-1:31:54
 Nolli.  Then he died and she married a Nolli.  No, Marlino. She married a Marlino.  That was number one.  Number two was Noli, N-O-L-L-I-E.  And he died, my mother's father died.  And then she married a Shulo.

SPEAKER_01: 1:31:54-1:31:55
 And then Shulo's that.

SPEAKER_00: 1:31:55-1:32:06
 But she never, that's the Shulo.  We called him the Shoemaker because he used to fix shoes.  And my mother had a stepsister and a stepbrother,

SPEAKER_01: 1:32:08-1:32:10
 from Moreno.  Half, half, half.

SPEAKER_00: 1:32:10-1:32:55
 The first one.  Half, excuse me, half.  What did I say?  You said step.  No, half.  Okay, then the second one, my mother had one, two,  there were four of them.  My uncle Jimmy and my aunt Grace and my mother  and her sister Wilma, who's the youngest. And then when, that was it. So she didn't  have any kids with this man. So her second husband died. Her second husband died.  And she remarried, you know, I don't remember, I think so. I think so.  I don't see.  They couldn't be alone back then.  That's true.  They could not be alone.  For some reason, and men too, the men,  they lose their wives or whatever,  they have to get married.  Yeah, well, that's what they did.  That's what they did.

SPEAKER_02: 1:32:55-1:33:02
 Probably it was the way you live.  Like, you know, you don't be alone.  You need to help each other.

SPEAKER_00: 1:33:02-1:33:25
 Yeah, and at that age, at that age,  it's a whole different thing than now,  because women didn't go to work that much.  You know, and.  But you're right about him with his mother, that's it.  That's sad.  And being the only son for a mother.  I have girls, so I don't know,  but I have a friend that has one only boy child,  and he has her, you know, it's just there,  they're everything, so I can imagine.  She was very proud of him.  So that was just tragic.

SPEAKER_02: 1:33:25-1:33:49
 So what I was telling you that I believe that,  so in those days, I think, I don't know how open  they were to each other in discussing issues  concerning their own private lives.  But I have no doubt that Lorraine knew about,  you know, about her son, about the fact  that it was unusual,  about his sexual orientation, but that's...

SPEAKER_00: 1:33:49-1:33:51
 But that didn't matter to her, because that was her son.

SPEAKER_02: 1:33:51-1:35:14
 She was really, really proud of who he was.  And he was successful.  Yeah, he was successful, and you know,  she wanted to show people what he has achieved.  And I can only imagine how, Also, another thing that, from  a certain point of view, is remarkable is that... So, Richard moves to LA, and a few  months later, finds a partner. And they live together for all those years. And the parents  knew the partner. And actually there is a letter,  that I found this beautiful letter.  The name of the partner was Bob.  And I found this beautiful letter that the mother wrote.  So Richard moved to Los Angeles, 1957.  Richard had been in Los Angeles for two years.  But now he's at a summer conference.  He's going to be in New Mexico for two months working on a project.  So the parents come from Oakland, they're still in Oakland, they come to Los Angeles  to do some fixing in the house, in the little cottage house, that's where they live.  And so that's where Bob lives, because they live together there.  And so they write this letter and the mother says, oh today I had a very nice afternoon  with Bob, we cooked together, blah blah. And then she adds, you  should be, you should try to be a little bit nicer with your friend. He's done so many

SPEAKER_01: 1:35:14-1:35:22
 good things for you. So now she's the mediator. She's the marriage counselor. 1957. That's

SPEAKER_02: 1:35:22-1:35:32
 very funny. And let's not forget another detail because it's an important detail.  Bob unfortunately died the year before I started this project.

SPEAKER_01: 1:35:32-1:35:33
 Oh no.

SPEAKER_02: 1:35:33-1:36:06
 I know, I know.  And they told me, I talked to the neighbor, and he lived in the very same house, the cottage.  So Richard was smart enough that, you know, decided because he was aware that if something  happens to me, nothing is going to be left to Bob. So he created a trust. was smart enough that, you know, decided because he was aware that if something  happens to me  nothing is going to be left to Bob. So he created a trust.  And the trust was put under Bob's name.  So when Richard died, that was the only thing that Bob got, but at least got the house.  So now,  the thing is that Bob was African-American.  So you can't, no, but imagine at that time.  Oh, that's very, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 1:36:06-1:36:10
 Oh, really?  Very forward.  Very forward.  Oh, my goodness.

SPEAKER_02: 1:36:10-1:36:21
 This woman, the fact that she has this unusual son who lives with an African-American man  and she writes in the letter, you should be nicer to Bob because he's done very good.

SPEAKER_00: 1:36:21-1:36:33
 She was ahead of her time, too.  Yeah, yeah.  She was a great...  Well, she probably went along, you know, I mean, it was her son and whatever he wanted,  that was it.  That's what you do.  I know that.  I know that.

SPEAKER_02: 1:36:33-1:38:29
 And also, I think there was a desire in Lorraine to achieve success.  She was coming from a family of pioneers.  Her mother, for one I've been able to reconstruct, was a similar character.  She had left, she had lost her mother early on. So, like, this is Lorraine's grandmother.  So Lorraine never met her grandmother. So her mother moved to San Jose as a, coming  from a poor family, alone, as a teacher. So she moved to San Jose in 1875. There they met her husband, who was  15 years older than her, from Ireland, but he had been in California for like 20-something,  30 years, making no success, I mean, as a peasant, like working. Now, he gets married  with her. Officially, she's a housewife, but now this man who is already 40 something has not achieved much.  Now, all of a sudden, gets married and besides seven daughters, seven girls, he becomes a  land owner.  They move to Lompoc as soon as Lompoc was created in 1880 something.  They buy land, they build a house, they become  like cattle owners, they own land, they get one of the best houses in Lompoc.  Now, sure, I'm sure that he worked hard, but how come that only happened once he got married?  So he dies and she lives for another 18 years without him and she takes care of all the girls.  All the girls go to high school.  Now we're talking about the end of the 20th century.  So sorry, the end of the 19th century was not common for if you only have girls and  there are seven of them, you send them all to high school.  They send to high school, they went for trips.  They made sure that those trips were known to the local newspaper so that they could  report Mrs. McKay went with their daughter, Lorraine.

SPEAKER_00: 1:38:29-1:38:33
 It's like the debutante.

SPEAKER_02: 1:38:33-1:38:43
 For a nice tour of the northern part of California.  For a nice tour of the Midwest.  Or they went all the way to the East Coast and they will be touring for the next six  weeks.

SPEAKER_01: 1:38:43-1:38:45
 Oh my goodness.  It should be written about in the paper.

SPEAKER_02: 1:38:45-1:38:53
 So you see that there is this thing already in the family.  In her family.  Oh sure.  And I'm sure that Lorraine absorbed this desire of arriving there.

SPEAKER_01: 1:38:53-1:38:54
 Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:38:54-1:39:15
 And in fact all those girls got married, with one exception, she married a doctor.  All the others got married with men that had good jobs, but they did not have the same  level of education.  Oh, okay.  So, you know, they already had a job. they were electricians, carpenters, working in  the oil field, for example.  So they were more educated, and Lorraine was more educated than her husband.

SPEAKER_01: 1:39:15-1:39:16
 Oh, see.

SPEAKER_02: 1:39:16-1:39:27
 Because, you know, he started as an electrician, in the Navy, then an electrician, and she  went to high school, and she was a very good student.  She was in the honor, she ranked second among like 100 something students.

SPEAKER_00: 1:39:27-1:39:30
 So she was a good student.  That's where Richard got his smarts.

SPEAKER_02: 1:39:30-1:39:38
 So there is this thing in that, like, I think Richard really realized something that, you  know, she was so, so proud of him.

SPEAKER_00: 1:39:38-1:39:52
 Yeah.  He wanted to make her proud too.  You know what?  I see it with myself, with my kids.  You feel like, you know, when  they've achieved something, it comes back to you and you feel like, you know, I'm a  part of this and it's just a good thing, you know?

SPEAKER_02: 1:39:52-1:39:55
 Also, imagine, I think, even more so if, sorry, I still...

SPEAKER_00: 1:39:55-1:39:56
 Oh, yes, go ahead.

SPEAKER_02: 1:39:56-1:39:59
 I'm choosing something before it goes bad.

SPEAKER_00: 1:39:59-1:40:00
 That's mozzarella.

SPEAKER_02: 1:40:00-1:40:08
 I think, hmm.  Okay.  No, because I also think that Lorraine, they lived in Stockton because of his job.

SPEAKER_00: 1:40:08-1:40:09
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 1:40:09-1:40:39
 Oh, that's probably.  Because for the Pacific Telephone, thank you, for the Pacific Telephone Company, he became,  he did career.  He went all the way up to the managerial area, which is the Stockton area.  Yes.  But I think that her desire, in fact, as soon as Richard went to Berkeley, they went with  him, they moved there, and  there is no evidence she ever went back to Stockton.  That is, she wanted to, like, I think she wanted to go to a different place.  Los Angeles for her was, I think, her dream.  She wanted to be glamorous.

SPEAKER_00: 1:40:39-1:40:46
 Yeah, because Oakland is not.  And I don't think it ever was.  Well, when it was then, it was different than it is now.

SPEAKER_02: 1:40:46-1:41:03
 Yeah, and they were leaving, actually, I went to check the area where they were leaving.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, because, you know, Oakland, and I have a dear friend that lives there, so she knows  Oakland very well, and Oakland can be scary for some people.  Oh, yeah, for some folks.  But they were leaving on Lakeshore Drive.  I went on Lakeshore Drive up the hill.

SPEAKER_00: 1:41:03-1:41:05
 Oh.  The Oakland Hills? Yeah, to Oakland Hills. Yeah,

SPEAKER_02: 1:41:05-1:41:46
 the Oakland Hills. Close towards like the area called Claremont. Where the Claremont Hotel is?  Piedmont. Oh yeah, that's money. Oh yeah, and the house that they had there was a really nice house.  And her sister Birdie, one of her sisters, the one that married the doctor was living just a few blocks  from where they were living. So they were in the nice upscale. Yeah they were nice upscale and then you know when they moved from  from Oakland they went to Los Angeles they were living in like this nice  neighborhood it's true that they were living in an apartment but they owned the  entire condo and you know it was just a couple. And their son had a beautiful house up there. Oh yeah, that was prestige.

SPEAKER_00: 1:41:46-1:42:12
 Oh yeah, exactly.  Living the dream, that's what I would say.  Living the dream.  But, oh well.  It's sad that he's had such a tragic thing  for that to happen to all, you know,  even to his mother.  I mean, it's just not right, not right.  But, oh well.  But now the Fefermans get to know him then. They knew it's just not right, not right. But now the Feffermans get to know him  then. They knew him because he was at, they were at, um, at Berkeley. No, you see, Berkeley.

SPEAKER_02: 1:42:13-1:43:56
 Yeah, because so Richard in 1948 moves to Berkeley to study. And, excuse me.  So Saul Pfefferman graduated from Caltech in Los Angeles, but in mathematics, in 1948. And he goes to do his PhD at Berkeley in 1948.  So he's a graduate student.  He was two years older than Richard.  He was a graduate student when Richard was still an undergraduate. But then when Richard starts doing his MA in  mathematics, he's working with the very same professor that Saul Pfefferman is  working with, Alfred Tarski. And now if you are a student of Tarski, then you get  to know each other because Tarski once a week would organize these parties at  this place. And so for example, all these students would be invited, all these graduate students  would be invited and according to your skills like for example there were people that are  good at singing they would sing and Richard would be one. Oh yes. And in fact Anita was telling me,  Saul's wife was telling me, oh I remember that because then you know wives and significant  others would be invited. So I remember Richard playing because you know  we were all having fun, laughing, drinking. Richard wouldn't drink to begin with. And  then when it was his time, you know, Alfred would say, Dick, it's time to play something.  You know, with this very Polish accent. And Polish accent. And so, they said, like, everybody would take it as like a joke, like it would be fun.  No, Richard was totally concentrated.  And he would start playing as if it was at a performance, at a concert.  Absolutely intense, totally intense.

SPEAKER_00: 1:43:56-1:43:58
 Yeah, now, man.  Did they call him Dick at that time, then?

SPEAKER_01: 1:43:58-1:44:00
 Not Richard?  Just the Polish professor.

SPEAKER_00: 1:44:00-1:44:08
 No, I was just going to say, he was Richard.  Yeah, Richard, I think, sometimes? Not Richard? Just the Polish professor.  No, I was just going to say, he was Richard.

SPEAKER_02: 1:44:08-1:44:12
 Yeah, Richard, I think some people call him Richie, depending on high school.

SPEAKER_00: 1:44:12-1:44:18
 I only remember him as Richard Montague.  I mean, it went together.

SPEAKER_02: 1:44:18-1:45:49
 I think he liked his full name.  Yeah.  In fact, Alma was telling me this little anecdote that  he said, Ivano, I remember him for various reasons and one reason  why I remember him is that he was the only one in the entire school that  whenever we run into each other he would say hi and he would say, he would call me  with my full name. Hi Alma Mae. Alma Mae. Yes. But nobody else,  otherwise he would call me Alma, but he would be the one. Alma Mae. And May, yes. How are you doing? What's your name? Yes, but nobody else, other  people would call me Alma, but he would be the one who called me May. And it stayed in  my mind and I kind of like it. I can see the obsessive pattern that you have done in a  certain way. That's your name, that's your name. And that's how you write it. Alma May  Bacciacalup funny. Richard, Richard.  That's okay.  In the case of his professor, there was this relationship.  I mean, Alfred Tarski,  I was told, was a  very charismatic figure.  He was a very short man.  But one of those men, when they opened their mouth,  it's like, you listen.  You listen.  You listen. it's like he says you know he would  come on the on the the lecture stand and smoking his cigar and there wouldn't be lecture notes  everything was in his mind he would start proving mathematical things all on the board all in his  mind and there was this like it was not just that he was smart, but he was also an actor.  He was a performer.  Like, you would be captured by him.

SPEAKER_00: 1:45:49-1:46:00
 That would be interesting then, because I'm not a big math person.  My husband is, and my kids are, but I am not.  And that would make you involved more when they have some kind of, you know.

SPEAKER_02: 1:46:00-1:46:14
 In particular, he was a man to whom you could not say no.  Nobody could say no to him.  He had this capacity of arguing, convincing, making you feel like, that there's no other  thing you can say than yes.

SPEAKER_00: 1:46:14-1:46:19
 There's no other way but his way.  His way.  Well, that's interesting.  Wow.  That's very...

SPEAKER_02: 1:46:19-1:46:58
 So Richard joined this group that Tarski had created as a way to, and there he developed,  he discovered the kind of field he wanted to work, he got stimulated by, it's not just the  professor, but then you have all these smart students around, so you learn from them too,  and you learn how to argue, you learn how to, you learn new things, or learn how to argue, you learn how to learn new things, you know, or learn how to build,  to express yourself. And he learned to be very, how do you say, the opposite of shy,  is like to be...

SPEAKER_01: 1:46:58-1:46:59
 Extrovert.

SPEAKER_02: 1:46:59-1:47:29
 More than an extrovert, I meant like he became aware of his intelligence.  Oh. More than an extrovert, I meant like he became aware of his intelligence and the fact that,  you know, and so assertive.  So he learned.  And I have this very interesting episode that I was told by somebody who became his friend  in high school.  He was two classes before you.  His name is still alive.  He lives in Fremont and I was happy to meet him, to encounter him like last year.  He and his wife, his name is Bob Robert, but it was called Bob Gilbo.  So, Gilbo.

SPEAKER_00: 1:47:29-1:47:30
 I remember that.

SPEAKER_02: 1:47:30-1:48:47
 Okay, Bob Gilbo, then he became a teacher.  And so Bob and Richard got very close  and they both had passion,  well, Bob had passion for boats  and Richard's father had a very nice yacht  in the Stockton the Stockton Canal.  And that's how actually Bob has this memory of Richard. This was before Richard, it was around 1942.  I had my little boat, I was 14, and there was this man with this beautiful boat, Mr. Montague.  And I knew that his name was Mr. Montague, I heard it,  and I was so jealous of that boat.  One day, I go to work on my little boat,  and this time, Mr. Montague is not alone.  There is like a 12, 13 year old kid on that beautiful boat,  and what is the kid doing?  He's reading a book.  And I thought, how on earth can you read a book  when you're in such a beautiful boat?  One year later, Richard arrives at St. Mary's, he recognizes him and says, well, you know,  it looked a little bit like out of place.  And so I took him under my wing.  I introduced him to my friends.  We started hanging out.  We went to the boats together.  We went to concerts together.

SPEAKER_00: 1:48:47-1:48:52
 I remember that name.  You're going to look him up now.  You're trying to find him now.

SPEAKER_02: 1:48:52-1:49:02
 And so, that's what he told me that, I don't know, that's how we got to know.  So he said, you know, he was kind of shy, not shy, but reserved.

SPEAKER_00: 1:49:02-1:49:05
 Here he is, right here.  Robert Clare Gilboa.  Yes, yes. Transferred from Stock Gilboa. Yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 1:49:05-1:49:18
 Transferred from Stockton High School. Yes, yes, yes. That's him. Yes. He was on the  kettle staff. He was on the kettle staff. Perfect memory. So, and so the episode, oh,

SPEAKER_00: 1:49:18-1:49:28
 oh yeah. Here have one of these. Oh wow. These are not homemade. These are sugar free. There's  no biscotti today because my Italian store was closed today.

SPEAKER_02: 1:49:28-1:49:32
 Look guys, this is fantastic. Thank you very much.

SPEAKER_00: 1:49:32-1:49:36
 Would you like some more water?

SPEAKER_02: 1:49:36-1:50:10
 What Bob told me is this nice episode.  They stayed in touch. Bob graduated. He wanted to work on  the commercial boats, and then Richard  went to study at Berkeley.  So, it's 1953, Richard is in Berkeley studying.  Bob found Barbara and they want to get married.  So, Bob writes Richard, and that's the letter that I found in the archives, so Richard kept  the letter.  Richard said, Richard, I want to give you hope you're doing okay, hope your parents are doing okay,  and I will let you know that Barbara and I decided to get married and we would love to  have you play the organ.

SPEAKER_01: 1:50:10-1:50:11
 A ceremony.

SPEAKER_02: 1:50:11-1:50:51
 Wow.  And so they make arrangement.  Richard replied, sure, I will not miss the opportunity for anything in the world.  So then Bob told me the story.  I said, okay.  Then I went to Oakland,  and I stayed with them,  and then this was two days before my wedding.  Then Richard and I drove together  the day before for the rehearsal.  Yes.  And so Richard could try the organ.  We arrived at the church,  and the official organist,  this 50 year old woman,  was there and she said,  nobody can touch this organ.  So just me.  I said, no, but look,  we want to pay you twice as much  not to play.  Not to play.  Not to play.  Not to play.  Oh my gosh.  Absolutely not.

SPEAKER_00: 1:50:51-1:50:55
 This is much.  This was the Presbyterian church?  No, this was the Catholic church.  Catholic church, wow.

SPEAKER_02: 1:50:55-1:51:00
 They were living in like one hour east of Oakland.

SPEAKER_00: 1:51:01-1:51:05
 Oh, east of Oak Creek.  Yeah, yeah.  Walnut Creek maybe? It's on the quay I think. Oh, Ple of Oak Creek. Yeah, yeah. Walnut Creek, maybe?

SPEAKER_02: 1:51:05-1:51:07
 It's on the quay, I think.  Oh, Pleasanton.

SPEAKER_00: 1:51:07-1:51:08
 Pleasanton.

SPEAKER_02: 1:51:08-1:51:12
 Maybe Pleasanton.  Yeah.  So, they were living, that's where the bride was from.

SPEAKER_00: 1:51:12-1:51:13
 Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_02: 1:51:13-1:52:51
 So, they drove there and Richard patiently sat down while she was playing.  So, he waited until the very end and then they did a rehearsal and then they were standing  there.  So, Bob said, I remember this very well in Barbara to the S  I remember because you know, I knew Richard is a very shy guy. Yeah, sir  Yeah, Richard says this was four years before and now after five years in Berkeley  It comes and it asked to the lady  Ma'am, how long have you been playing the organ for I have been playing the organ for more than 30 years  But if I were you  I wouldn't say it's embarrassing. Absolutely serious! There was a moment!  And Bob said, there I realized that something had changed in Richard. He had no problem to assert himself.  And he said of course he was right. she was totally clumsy and Richard was a much better organ player. But he stated that in front of her.  So Richard was like, at the point was, so it was July 1953, so it was 22 and a half  in front of this 50 something year old woman. But he was stating the truth. It was embarrassing  for her. Oh, I can't picture him doing that. No. Yeah. So that was the truth. And it was embarrassing for her to pretend to play. Oh, I can't picture him doing that.  So that was the change.  And so this is something that then continued at UCLA.  What I collected is this.  With students, he would always be very sweet, very nice, very patient.  The idea being that a student has to learn.  But with his colleagues, the expectation would be very high.  And if you don't satisfy those expectations,  you shouldn't be in the job, you should change job.  So implacable.

SPEAKER_00: 1:52:51-1:52:57
 I mean, once again.  Yeah, yeah, I didn't know, wow.  So did he get to play the organ?  No?  No.  Oh, he didn't, no?

SPEAKER_02: 1:52:57-1:53:01
 He went to the wedding.  Oh, the wedding, but he didn't.  I have a picture that shows that.  The mother was there too.

SPEAKER_00: 1:53:01-1:53:02
 Oh, wow.

SPEAKER_02: 1:53:02-1:53:04
 But...

SPEAKER_00: 1:53:04-1:53:13
 Now, when you are done with this whole thing,  it's gonna be like a thesis, what is it?  It's gonna be, is there something we can see after?  Oh yeah.

default: 1:53:13-1:53:13
 Oh.

SPEAKER_02: 1:53:13-1:53:20
 Oh yeah, oh.  Okay.  So first of all, the premier book.

SPEAKER_00: 1:53:20-1:53:24
 A book?  Published by.  Oh, oh okay, well we'll buy it.

default: 1:53:24-1:53:25
 Okay, sorry. The do we'll buy it. Sorry.

SPEAKER_02: 1:53:25-1:53:29
 The dookie was delicious, but it got stuck to me.  I know.  I know.  I spoke too much.

SPEAKER_01: 1:53:29-1:53:32
 I know.  I know, because I spoke too much.  It's lemon.

SPEAKER_02: 1:53:32-1:55:55
 It's lemon.  It's delicious.  Yeah.  So, Oxford University Press, which is one of the main academic publisher, is going to  publish it as a book that's going to be found in bookstores in general, like similar to the  biography of Tarski.  The goal for the book, that's a goal that I have in mind, is I want this book to be  for a general audience. So I want to write the story of Richard's personal and intellectual  development in a way that is accessible to everybody who is interested,  without any philosophical or mathematical background.  So the way I'm writing the book now is in a way like  I want the main story to be a story that is independent  as much as possible, independent from any kind of technical details.  And then there are going to be some special sections  in which I say, look, if you have this logical background  or if you have this mathematical background and you want  to know more about it, you can read this part.  But if you don't, if you skip it,  you're not missing anything in the story.  Okay, so the story continues independently from that.  So that according to what kind of readers you are  and what interests you have, you can decide  in which direction you want to go.  But I really, I don't want this to be just  a purely academic product that can be read  because I think there is something important  in the history of Richard on many, many levels.  There is intellectual achievements that he achieved  and he created my field of studies  and that's gonna be at the center of the book.  But there are also other important things.  For example, Richard is one of those, and there are many others examples, of those beautiful  minds that the neglected Central California produced.  Because Richard is like many of you guys, comes from Central California, comes from  a family that started not even middle  class. It was lower middle class or low class. So because of number one, the possibility  of going up the social scale, but also education available easily to everybody because now  you told me the price, even the private school was really accessible because... Well, yeah. I know like Richard's father, because the last census, you know, the census data are  by law, they need to be made available, but by law you need to wait 70 years.

SPEAKER_00: 1:55:55-1:55:56
 Oh, 70?

SPEAKER_02: 1:55:56-1:55:58
 70.  Wow.

SPEAKER_01: 1:55:58-1:55:59
 For privacy reasons.

SPEAKER_02: 1:55:59-1:56:01
 So the last one that is available is 1940.

SPEAKER_01: 1:56:01-1:56:02
 Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_02: 1:56:02-1:56:25
 So on the census of 1940, I know that Richard's father was declaring  at least that he was making $1,500 a year from Pacific.  Oh, $1,500. $1,500.  Wow. Now, if you pay $3 a month, which means that  by the end of the year, let's even say 10 months, you pay $30, but your income is $1,500.

SPEAKER_00: 1:56:25-1:56:28
 But he was paying $5 if he wasn't Catholic.

SPEAKER_02: 1:56:28-1:56:30
 Okay, $50.  He was paying $5.

SPEAKER_00: 1:56:30-1:56:31
 $50.

SPEAKER_02: 1:56:31-1:57:09
 $50.  So $50 means that, like, how many times, if you divide $1,500 by 5, you get $300, okay?  So what, sorry, by 30. So what it means, it means that his family, the cost of St. Mary was 1 30th.  Is it correct?  Let me see, like 1,500 divided by 3, 150.  No, sorry.  It was 1.  So it, how can you say it in English?  It was one three hundredth.

SPEAKER_01: 1:57:09-1:57:10
 Oh, three hundredth.

SPEAKER_02: 1:57:10-1:57:18
 So in other words, if the father was making $1,500 a year  and they were only paying $5 a month,  let's multiply it by 10 months, so 50.

SPEAKER_00: 1:57:18-1:57:22
 Yeah, because I don't remember  if we had to pay the whole year.  No, if I only had to pay that same amount.

SPEAKER_02: 1:57:22-1:58:09
 So basically, you need to multiply 30 times to get to $1,500.  Which means that these days, like you told me that you had to pay like $8,000.  Now that means that if you do the same multiplication, it means that you multiply by 30, it means  that you have an income of $250,000.  Now an income of $250,000 is not an income of  somebody that worked for the phone company. So, Berkeley, I was told that Berkeley was  the same thing. Actually, even cheaper. So, the entire year at Berkeley, the fees that  you have to pay for the entire year at Berkeley, $70.00. $70. $70. $70. $70. $70 for the entire academic year.  Oh my gosh.

SPEAKER_00: 1:58:09-1:58:09
 Really?

SPEAKER_02: 1:58:09-1:58:10
 Yes.  $90.

SPEAKER_00: 1:58:10-1:58:15
 Did they not have scholarships back then?  Or did they get academic money?

SPEAKER_02: 1:58:15-1:58:35
 Richard got a scholarship when he became a graduate student  for three years.  He got this very special scholarship,  which looked like designed for him,  because it was a scholarship for people that were in the field of philosophy but they were studying  mathematically related subjects.  Oh.  And they were studying languages.

SPEAKER_01: 1:58:35-1:58:36
 Oh, languages.

SPEAKER_02: 1:58:36-1:58:50
 And Richard, I mean, in high school he took three languages, Latin, Spanish and French.  What?  But then when he went to college, he kept studying.  So he took like six years of Arabic, he studied Hebrew,

SPEAKER_00: 1:58:50-1:58:54
 he studied ancient Greek, he studied Polish,

SPEAKER_02: 1:58:54-1:59:26
 and I have independent evidence  that he knew Italian and German.  That gives you an idea of like.  $70.  I know.  I think I spent almost $50,000.  I think this is an important, something that I want the book to highlight is the fact that education,  the fact that education was accessible,  allowed these bright minds  to have space and room for development,  despite coming from families with a poor background.

SPEAKER_00: 1:59:26-2:00:09
 But you know, things were cheaper.  Well, obviously it's all relative.  When it's all relevant, that's right.  But what I'm saying is, in those days,  everything was cheaper.  Well, yes, because the wages were 50 cents an hour.  That's what I'm saying.  So they were sort of according to what you were making.  You did have different classes.  Now, yeah, well, I know that.  But going to the store and stuff like that, food was different.  And so maybe they did struggle to pay the $5 a month for him.  I mean, they wanted him to go to that school  because they knew how bright he was, I'm sure,  rather than go to a public school.

SPEAKER_02: 2:00:09-2:00:10
 Yeah, and also, don't you think that...

SPEAKER_00: 2:00:10-2:00:13
 And they struggled, I mean,  they might have struggled to send him there.

SPEAKER_02: 2:00:13-2:00:25
 I was wondering also, what do you think, Jo, about,  when I ask people about Stockton High,  everybody told me that it was a much larger school.  Oh, it is.  It was a much larger school. Big class sizes.. It was a much larger school. It's bigger.

SPEAKER_01: 2:00:25-2:00:26
 And class size.

SPEAKER_02: 2:00:26-2:00:32
 Yeah.  And also they said that the impression,  I mean, of course these are all people  that went to St. Mary's.  Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 2:00:32-2:00:33
 So they have that impression.

SPEAKER_02: 2:00:33-2:00:57
 Right.  Except Bob.  Bob went first to Octonine  and then he transferred to St. Mary's.  But, so I wonder if part of the reason  why the Montague decided to send it to St. Mary's  is because St. Mary's was a good high school to begin with.  And also I think, that's again, that's an opinion that I have, I don't have direct evidence,  but St. Mary's could have been more protective.  Like, for example, like...

SPEAKER_00: 2:00:57-2:01:00
 Because of being Catholic, you mean? Or just where it is?

SPEAKER_02: 2:01:00-2:01:05
 Because, well, the nuns, what I was told is that the nuns were very good at keeping the discipline.

SPEAKER_01: 2:01:05-2:01:06
 Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:01:06-2:01:13
 Oh no, they were.  Like your classmates told me, like, you know, when we were to walk in the hall, we had to  be on a line, at the end of the distance.

SPEAKER_01: 2:01:13-2:01:14
 Oh yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:01:14-2:01:30
 You had to measure and so on.  And you know, sure, there were some kids that were not well behaving, but they would be  stopped right away.  So they would only...  Discipline.  They had more discipline. Yeah, the discipline was important,  which also meant for somebody like Richard,  which was not...

SPEAKER_00: 2:01:30-2:01:33
 No, he would not have gotten into all that stuff anyway.

SPEAKER_02: 2:01:33-2:01:50
 So I wonder if their concern was like,  well, if we send him to that school,  we know that that school is smaller,  and the nuns are good at keeping the discipline,  which may protect Richard from like bullies, being attacked, being discriminated.

SPEAKER_00: 2:01:50-2:02:37
 But you know, I don't know that we discriminated because we had different, I don't think we  had too many, I don't think there was any black people in our class.  I don't remember any black people at all.  But in those, that was 15 years ago.  But we had Hispanics.  Yeah, Didia Gonzalez, she was Mexican, Spanish or whatever.  But we all got along with each other then,  but it's not like now, where, you know.  But the Catholic schools have not changed,  because my kids, when they go to a dance,  my kids went to all girls school.  We have an all boys Catholic school on all girls.  Two, we used that too.

SPEAKER_02: 2:02:37-2:02:38
 Is it here in Sacramento?

SPEAKER_00: 2:02:38-2:03:08
 Right here in Sacramento, yeah.  And then we have Jesuit, which is right over here.  Jesuit is the all boys, Jesuit, you know,  Jesuit priest Catholic school.  But when they go to a dance together, they would tell them, and this is just my kids,  you know, this is not my kids, but they would say, when they were dancing, they come up,  leave room for the Holy Ghost between them.  So they weren't, you know, dancing.  So I never forgot that.  Leave room for the Holy Ghost.  Not the Holy Spirit, you know that.

SPEAKER_02: 2:03:08-2:03:09
 The Holy Ghost.

SPEAKER_00: 2:03:09-2:03:32
 No, what, I know, I remember when we came here,  and there was Jesuit for the boys,  and we had Loretto at that time.  Loretto, because now it's closed.  And that was all girls,  and then St. Francis was all girls.  But see, St. Mary's was the only integrated Catholic school around.  I mean I didn't know any better because...

SPEAKER_02: 2:03:32-2:03:36
 But when you went to the public school, it was already called?

SPEAKER_00: 2:03:36-2:04:56
 Oh yeah, it was already...  See I don't know about St. Angus, it was Fair Oaks.  In fact, she lives in Fair Oaks now.  And I went to Fair Oaks school, which was near... We walked, I walked. It was right Oaks. In fact, she lives in Fair Oaks now. And I went to Fair Oaks School, which was near,  we walked, I walked.  Was right in that neighborhood.  Yeah, it was down on Main Street.  But, and anyway, it finally got torn down eventually  for something, for houses, I think.  But it's not there anymore.  But we were integrated then.  Yeah, but see here, I don't know why they went  to only girls and only boys.  We did have a co-ed Catholic high school,  but it closed, Bishop Manoog.  Oh, Bishop Manoog, Christian Brothers is even.  Oh, we do have one.  Yeah, Christian Brothers is both.  My girls loved it, you know why?  My girls, neither one of them were boy crazy or anything,  they were more into sports and stuff.  But they loved it because when you went to school  in the morning, you'd just get up, throw on your skirt,  don't make up, you don't have to do your hair.  You know, that was all, you know, this is the best.  We don't have to worry about how we look at school  because somebody's gonna be, you know, whatever.  And everybody, and then the uniform was a very good thing.  Well that was good even here because you don't have to worry about changing you know how  nowadays everybody has to...  But if they're wearing a uniform then you don't have the girl with the A-mark letter.

SPEAKER_02: 2:04:56-2:05:09
 You're right.  But I was told, I don't know if you agree, Jo, I was told that there were some rules  though as St. Mary's in terms of what you could wear, you could not wear.

SPEAKER_00: 2:05:09-2:05:12
 There probably were, but I don't remember that.  I mean...

SPEAKER_02: 2:05:12-2:05:28
 Like for example, I was told, I think it was Mary that remembered that, or was Bernice?  So, oh no, Alma, Alma.  Alma?  Yeah, so she remembered that I think once she was wearing a sweater with no shirt under.

SPEAKER_00: 2:05:28-2:05:32
 Oh, okay.  Oh, and they got mad.  Well, there's nuns who would have been mad.

SPEAKER_02: 2:05:32-2:05:36
 Yeah, yeah.  She was sent to a place to wear a...

SPEAKER_00: 2:05:36-2:05:38
 Yeah, I never had that problem.

SPEAKER_02: 2:05:38-2:05:42
 So, they wanted to wear a shirt with a neck under.

SPEAKER_00: 2:05:42-2:05:47
 Yeah, yeah, and then you could put your sweater over it.  Yes, that was...

SPEAKER_02: 2:05:47-2:05:55
 And then for the boys, they told me,  I think Ben and Ed remember that  you had to wear, well, first of all,  you had to wear long pants, you couldn't wear shorts.

SPEAKER_00: 2:05:55-2:05:56
 Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:05:56-2:06:02
 And then no jeans, but they had to be...  Like khakis.  Like khakis, yeah, that's what they were.

SPEAKER_00: 2:06:02-2:06:17
 Yeah, that was true, but I mean,  that was the only thing, I mean, you could what they wear. Yeah, that was true, but I mean, that was the only thing.  I mean, you could wear more or less whatever you wanted.  I mean, but in those days, we didn't wear skirts.  No, but we never did, in those days, we never did anyway.

SPEAKER_02: 2:06:17-2:06:19
 Oh, okay, so we were not, I say.

SPEAKER_00: 2:06:19-2:06:32
 No, I mean, we didn't wear that, you know,  in my, when I was younger, we didn't wear pants that much.  We always wore skirts or dresses or stuff like that.  We never wore pants.  But as far as that goes, no, no, I just was looking at this picture.  Oh, and I got that picture.

SPEAKER_02: 2:06:32-2:06:34
 You're all wearing like, you say...

SPEAKER_00: 2:06:34-2:06:40
 Yeah, we all got skirts and sweaters and, you know, jackets or whatever, but no.

SPEAKER_02: 2:06:40-2:06:44
 And with the guys, yeah, they're all wearing, so all of them are wearing shirts.

SPEAKER_00: 2:06:44-2:07:04
 Shirts with maybe a sweater.  Yeah, but not T-shirts.  No T-shirts, no.  No T-shirts, yeah, barely not.  No, I don't think so.  That was the only thing.  But as far as clothes go, there's Ed Brennan, my God.  I'm surprised you remember all these people.  Yeah, me too.  I don't remember them all.  There's Don Gamboni right there.  And that's Lucille Elliott.

SPEAKER_02: 2:07:04-2:07:08
 So which one is Don Gamboni? Because There's Don Gamboni right there. And that's Lucille Elliott.  Which one is Don Gamboni?  Because that's Don Gamboni.

SPEAKER_00: 2:07:08-2:07:17
 And this is Lucille Elliott.  That's Chisholm.  What is that picture from?  I don't know what it was from.  They took a picture.

SPEAKER_02: 2:07:17-2:07:22
 I don't know what it was from.  Let me see.  Is that the picture in front of the...

SPEAKER_00: 2:07:22-2:07:26
 In front of the...  It looks like in front of the church. Oh, the door. I think that of the... looks like in front of the church.

SPEAKER_02: 2:07:26-2:07:32
 Oh, the door. I think that's the...  That's the doors of the church, I think.  Yeah, ok, so I think I have...

SPEAKER_00: 2:07:32-2:07:34
 This is Huddleston right here.

SPEAKER_02: 2:07:34-2:07:42
 So this is the picture that you guys  took... is that the same one or is it a different one?  Oh no, that was the  sophomore picture.

SPEAKER_00: 2:07:42-2:07:47
 This is earlier.  Here, let me hold the plate. I'll hold it, go ahead. more pictures. This is earlier.

SPEAKER_02: 2:07:47-2:08:21
 What I did, I made a bigger one and then I have a smaller one with the names next to it.  In some cases. That one is not it. Is that it right there?  No, that's different. You guys were always going to the same place.  No, I don't have it. I thought I saw it when you flip. No, you see this one is a different one.  Oh, I thought I saw it when you flip. No, I think it's the Honor Society. No, no.  You see it's a slightly different one. Yeah, I was not on the Honor Society.

SPEAKER_00: 2:08:21-2:08:26
 I was not on the Honor Society. There's Andrew Wolfe.

SPEAKER_02: 2:08:26-2:08:27
 Who is Andrew Wolfe?

SPEAKER_00: 2:08:27-2:08:48
 Andrew Wolfe.  Oh, that's Andrew Wolfe.  That's Andrew Wolfe.  Let's see. God, it's been a while.  You'll have to give them all the phone numbers.  That was Catherine. Catherine ended up being Lucille's sister-in-law.  That's how come I remember her.  That's Genevieve Peters.

SPEAKER_02: 2:08:48-2:08:49
 Oh, that's her.

SPEAKER_00: 2:08:49-2:08:57
 That's Genevieve.  That's Wallace.  And you can probably tell, that's Richard Wallace.  That's Richard Wallace?

SPEAKER_01: 2:08:57-2:08:58
 Uh-huh.  Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 2:08:58-2:09:22
 Of course.  And Ellen D. Russell.  Where the heck is she?  There's Wadad. Wadad Rishwani. Oh, yeah. That's her. Russell, where the heck is she? There's Wadad.  Wadad Rishway.  Oh, yeah, that's her.

She was pretty smart, too.

SPEAKER_02: 2:09:22-2:09:23
 Wow, an amazing memory, wow.

SPEAKER_00: 2:09:23-2:09:31
 She was pretty smart, too.  But I don't remember her name.  It'll come to me eventually.  In the middle of the night she'll remember.  In the middle of the night I'll remember.  Yeah, I'll go to bed tonight.

SPEAKER_02: 2:09:31-2:09:33
 Is Mary Simonelli in this picture too?

SPEAKER_00: 2:09:33-2:09:38
 Yeah, wait a minute.  Mary Simonelli, that's Genevieve.  Where's Mary?

SPEAKER_02: 2:09:38-2:09:39
 Maybe she's not in this picture.

SPEAKER_00: 2:09:39-2:09:43
 Maybe here.  Oh, I see.  Maybe that's her.  You're right, you're right.

SPEAKER_02: 2:09:43-2:09:49
 From other pictures that I saw earlier, you're right. I think that's her. You're right. You're right. That could be... You're right. You're right. From  other pictures that I saw, you're right. I think that's her. You're right. But she married...

SPEAKER_00: 2:09:49-2:10:35
 What was the thing? She married... Who'd she marry? God bless it. I can't help you. I know  you can't. I can't help you with some stuff. No, but she married an Italian guy, I think, another Italian guy. What the heck was his name?  Shazoo.  These are not my class.  See, Lois Cody, you know who Lois Cody is? Related to Buzz.  Buzz Cody, who lived around the corner from me.  His sister, we found out that,  a neighbor that lived around the corner a long time ago.  When we moved here in the 1960s, you know.  His sister was in my class.  We have a lot of, there's a lot of weird things.  Yeah, it all comes back, you know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:10:35-2:10:37
 I know.  So you moved to this neighborhood in the 60s?

SPEAKER_00: 2:10:37-2:10:47
 We moved to this neighborhood.  December of 1960.  1960, because my husband, after we got married,  I moved from Stockton to San Francisco.

SPEAKER_02: 2:10:47-2:10:48
 Uh-huh, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 2:10:48-2:10:59
 Because that's where my husband was from.  And we lived there for,  52 to 60.  And she was, I think, seven when we moved here.

SPEAKER_02: 2:10:59-2:11:01
 Great time to be in San Francisco in those years.

SPEAKER_00: 2:11:01-2:11:21
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Those years were really beautiful years.  Oh yeah, those were nice. Those were nice.  Much better than now.  Yeah.  I go back and I'm like, oh my god, I want to just kill some of these people.  Yeah, no.  But they were both born in San Francisco, my son and her.  They're two years apart, a little over two years apart.  Then we moved here and the weather was phenomenal compared to...

SPEAKER_02: 2:11:21-2:11:23
 Oh, I see.  Except in the summer.

SPEAKER_00: 2:11:23-2:11:27
 I used to have to wear socks with my sandals.  That was the worst thing ever, you know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:11:27-2:11:29
 And you come here and say, oh, the sun.

SPEAKER_00: 2:11:29-2:11:49
 The sun is out, yes.  The sun is here.  And with the heat here, you know, they took them away.  No, and then we've been in this house for 50 plus years.  Wow.  So my parents, they celebrated 60 years of marriage in 2012.  So, yeah, they would have had... We went on our 60th of marriage in 2012. So yeah, they would have had.  We went on our 60th anniversary cruise with everybody.

SPEAKER_02: 2:11:49-2:11:51
 Wow, congratulations.

SPEAKER_00: 2:11:51-2:14:42
 That's really an achievement.  We've got some longevity in our family with that.  Well, my father-in-law died at 90.  90 and her mother died at 95.  My mother was still driving at 90.  Wow.  Be happy you weren't there doing the research  with deep driving. Because we would go like this. You know, father, you just gave us still driving at 90. Wow! Be happy you weren't there doing the research with Jesus. We would  go like this. Father Jesus, Jesus, oh, oh, oh. No, no. She passed away at 94. Wow. In  Stockton. I used to go back and forth every week. She stayed in Stockton. She stayed in  Stockton, yeah. She lived by herself. She would never leave her home. No. That home  that I showed you. Oh, that was the famous one. She would never leave her home. That  was the house, yeah. She didn't want to come here because it would have been easier. She's the only child to come and live,  not with her, but you know.  But then she got congestive heart failure  and then she went to a hospital  and then she finally went to a convalescent home.  But then she didn't want to stay there  and she wanted to go home.  And the doctor said, well, you cannot go home  unless you have somebody there to take care of you.  So as it happened, this little Filipino lady  was at the convalescent home visiting her husband.  And she said, I can take care of her,  and I knew her from nothing.  And I will say that the Filipino people are like the,  we have Fiji people here now that take care of people,  the most family-oriented, care about seniors, you know. She was wonderful. Yeah, so she said, well, I can take care of people, the most family-oriented, care about seniors, you know.  She was wonderful.  She really took care of my kids.  So she said, well, I can take care of her.  Because I said, I couldn't go back and forth.  She wouldn't come here.  And she wouldn't come here.  So we had Toadie for quite a while.  And I'd go down once a week to bring her stuff she liked.  So spinach and that kind of stuff.  Zucchini.  Zucchini, yeah, all that kind of stuff.  And I would go once a week and bring her stuff  and then come back.  And then we had to steal her.  It started to get hard on her because  it's a big, hot work.  Then she kept saying, you know,  she had the car yet in the garage  because it was a separate garage than the house.  And she wanted to drive.  And I said, no ma. she said I can still drive.  And I said.  My grandmother, my noni was very opinionated,  very firm, assertive, you knew where you stood with her.  And she said, I'm driving,  you're not telling me I can't drive.  So I said, I know you can drive mom,  but we don't want you to drive anymore.  I said, if you wanna go anywhere,  Toady will take you wherever you want to go, right?  I know.  Well, then one weekend we went down  and took the car out of the garage  and my husband fixed it so that,  cause she had the door opener,  and he fixed it so she couldn't open the door.  And then, no, she couldn't do that.  I mean, if she even tried,  she used to back it out and wash it on the driveway.  And that's as far as she would get.  And she would mow her own lawn.  She was very, very independent.  My mother was very strong.  Very independent.  We come from good genes.  Good stuff.  Anyway.

SPEAKER_02: 2:14:42-2:14:44
 Testa-dora.

SPEAKER_00: 2:14:44-2:14:48
 I know all those good words.  We have a grandson like that. I have a grandson.

SPEAKER_02: 2:14:48-2:15:39
 Well, you know,  talking about genes, you get the good things  and you get the bad things.  Yeah, I know.  So we don't select our genes.  No, we just have to go with the flow.  So, Jo, I want to ask you,  I don't want to keep bothering you, but I want to ask you,  if you remember anything else from those years, it doesn I want to ask you, I don't want to keep bothering you, but I want to ask you, if you remember anything else  from those years, it doesn't need to be related  to Richard directly, but anything else of those years  at St. Mary's that can help?  Because I would like to give my readers an idea  of what it meant to be at St. Mary's.  Like, it could be as a student, the kind of atmosphere,  or also something that you may remember about Stockton,  like what it meant to be a teenager in Stockton  in those years.  Because your readers don't, my readers and your reader,  the readers of your story won't know what it meant.  They grew up in a different world and different universe.

SPEAKER_00: 2:15:39-2:16:00
 Well, that's true.  And in those days, it was a good place to be from.  And I, like I say, we were in the-  You were a good kid.  I was a good kid.  I was an only child.  I had no, you know, and my parents really took care.  And then we lived with my grandparents,  which was different too,  because not too many people lived at the same house  with their grandparents.

SPEAKER_02: 2:16:00-2:16:03
 It was not common at that time?  Because in Italy, it was very common.

SPEAKER_00: 2:16:03-2:16:44
 Well, in Italy it was.  In Italy it was. But of course, in Italy it was. In Italy it was.  But, of course, I can't say that because my cousins who lived across the street, the  Gaddis, they lived, Mary lived with her mother too, with her mother-in-law in the same thing.  But most of the non-Italians, I guess I should say, didn't do that.  They had their own houses and they lived differently.  But it was fine.  I had a pretty sheltered life, I guess.  Every year we'd go to Santa Cruz for a holiday for a week.  We had to do that.  And my father loved it.  He used to like to walk on the boardwalk and stuff like that.

SPEAKER_02: 2:16:44-2:16:49
 So you don't have memories, for example, of the period during the war being a tough one?

SPEAKER_00: 2:16:49-2:17:36
 Well, yeah, my father belonged to the... we had to pull the shades down and you know, and and  he was one of those guys that walked... was a  captain of something or other. When the war broke out, I can remember we were on a... We used to go on Sundays on a drive.  Every Sunday we'd go someplace. Like within Stockholm? Well, anywhere out of Stockholm,  the little country places like that. And I remember he had the radio on and that's when  the war started. December 7, 1941. Wow. And I can remember hearing that.  And then after, yeah, Pearl Harbor, yeah.  So I can remember that.  And we were just on a drive, just to go out.  We didn't do it.  You said there were certain times

SPEAKER_01: 2:17:36-2:17:38
 that they would do the air raid thing.

SPEAKER_00: 2:17:38-2:18:56
 Yeah, the air raid thing.  And you'd have to pull your shades down.  And after I moved here, I really was  upset because of what they did to the poor Japanese, which  was really horrible.  And that camp was in Stockton.  Well, no.  The camp where Alma met Louis was at the camp.  And it was in Stockton, and there was one  in Pittsburgh, California.  And my father got friendly with some of the people.  And we used to drive to Pittsburgh. How far is it from here?  From Pittsburgh, from Stockton. I don't know, an hour and a half maybe.  Okay, so it's a little bit of a drive. But he got friendly and he used to bring the  prisoners home  and for on me and... Yeah, I was told that you were allowed like during the weekend.  You were allowed to bring them home and for dinner and stuff like...  And he got really friendly with a couple of them.  And then he'd drive them back.  And you know, they were a little more lenient there  than they were in Guantanamo or whatever.  You know, but that's how Alma met Louis.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and then because he was a prisoner of war from Italy.  And that's... He went back to Italy.  Oh, like the Japanese you're talking about.  No, no, no, the Japanese were different. They took them all and put them in camps.  These were prisoners, these were Italian soldiers.

SPEAKER_01: 2:18:56-2:18:57
 Oh, Italian soldiers.

SPEAKER_02: 2:18:57-2:19:07
 Like for example, I believe that Alma's future husband was captured in Africa by the Americans and then took here as a prisoner.

SPEAKER_00: 2:19:07-2:19:10
 Yeah, and I don't know why they took them.

SPEAKER_02: 2:19:10-2:19:14
 Me too, I was like, eagerly, I'm the guy at the door.

SPEAKER_00: 2:19:14-2:19:15
 I know, I know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:19:15-2:19:39
 Well, because probably if you, like, it was captured by the American army, military,  and so Americans, they were in charge of their prisoners.  You don't dump the prisoners.  Also, Europe in that period,  so we're talking about 42, 43,  it was not accessible because it was still under the Nazis,  under the control by the Nazis,  so they probably, they put on their ship  and they distributed them through.

SPEAKER_00: 2:19:39-2:20:49
 Yeah, they had them here, there, and everywhere,  and I know there was a camp in Stockton,  but there was also a camp in Pittsburgh, California.  And that's where we, I think that's where Alma met Louie.  And then he went home, I guess, and then she went,  I remember it was in January, and she went to,  because he was from Parma, I believe he was from Parma.  Yes, he told me that, yeah.  And she got married in January,  and I remember her having to wear,  she got married in this nice white dress.  And it was so cold in the churches  because they didn't have heaters in there.  She had to have this little fur jacket.  And I can remember that for her wedding.  I didn't go.  But when she came home, they gave them a party in their basement,  in the mother and father's basement,  who lived on Cleveland, I think, Cleveland, 26 East,  I think it's 26, anyhow.  Wow.  Off of Pacific Avenue.  Yeah, yeah.  And they had a basement in their nice brick house.  And I remember them having a party for them  when they got back, and he could come, you know,  she had to stay there for a while until he was allowed to come back. To come back, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:20:49-2:20:50
 Because of, you know...

SPEAKER_00: 2:20:50-2:20:53
 When did they let him go then?  I don't remember.

SPEAKER_02: 2:20:53-2:20:59
 Okay, so she got married with him...  because she told me that she had to leave in Italy.

SPEAKER_00: 2:20:59-2:21:00
 Yeah, she did.

SPEAKER_02: 2:21:00-2:22:08
 Right after the Second World War.  Yeah.  Which meant that she really experienced the poorest moment of Italy because Italy had  been partially destroyed.  And there was no food, resources there to rebuild everything.  And she was still lucky because at least her husband was from the center of Parma.  So it was not from the countryside. So at least she was  in an urban setting. Yes. Not in a big city because Parma was small at that time.  Exactly, in the middle of nowhere. Isn't that where Biba's from? And also I think that his family was at  least middle class because her house was facing one of Parma's main squares.  So probably, you know, you wouldn't live there if you were part of a poor family.  But still, it's Italy after the Second World War.  So she remembered that she had to learn how you bath by warming up the water on the stove  first.  And then you use one bucket and you make it last.  Because that's it, otherwise there's no other water.

SPEAKER_00: 2:22:08-2:22:18
 I didn't realize that. I didn't know she had to go back.  Oh yeah, she went back to get married over there.  The mother and the father, I guess that's who went.  And Alma, because Alma was an only child.

SPEAKER_02: 2:22:18-2:22:21
 Yeah, she was.  Didn't have any brothers.  Yeah, she's the only one.

SPEAKER_00: 2:22:21-2:22:22
 And so...

SPEAKER_02: 2:22:22-2:22:29
 And her parents went with her when the wedding happened.  I believe so, yes.  Oh yeah, it was a long trip in those days, yes.

SPEAKER_00: 2:22:29-2:22:52
 But then Jay came back, and then when they came back, the father gave them a little wedding party, and their house had a basement.  Yeah, well they lived on the same street as the mother and father, but further up. It's like a miracle mile.  It's off of the miracle mile.  Pacific Avenue, not too far from Pacific Avenue.

SPEAKER_02: 2:22:52-2:22:57
 She was commenting on the fact that her family, you know, like my parents were living there,  I still live there.

SPEAKER_00: 2:22:57-2:23:27
 Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Her house was...  You ought to call her.  Yeah, I should.  Her son lives here in town, I think.  Ronald. She has a son named Ronald machin yeah yeah yeah and I believe he  lives in Sacramento. Mancini and Mancini yeah I know well it's close yeah and her  father was a nice man he owned a bicycle shop and she told me that and then he's the one, he gave you your first red tricycle. Oh, no. See, this is all stuff.

SPEAKER_02: 2:23:27-2:23:43
 I wish I had it.  In fact, because I was showing Alma Mae the picture of Richard on the bike.  And she said, oh, I do remember because I was biking to school.  Because she said, you know, oh, you had a bike.  So this is a picture from the...

SPEAKER_00: 2:23:43-2:23:45
 Oh, God, look at that bicycle

SPEAKER_02: 2:23:45-2:24:09
 and with the basket. And so they made me notice two things. Alma Mae made me notice the fact that  he's, you know, he's biking. So yeah, yeah. I mean, isn't that a dog in there? It looks like,  but actually what do you think it is? No, I think what it is, Richard and a dog. It's like some sort  of a jacket, I think. I think it might be a jacket. And what you see on top of here, two of them remember this detail, Richard had a briefcase.  A briefcase!  Oh yes!  Which was very unusual for a kid.

SPEAKER_00: 2:24:09-2:24:12
 Yes, to have a briefcase.  Do you remember that?  No, I don't remember the briefcase.

SPEAKER_02: 2:24:12-2:24:23
 But they told me, because I said, but how would you guys, what would you normally do  it?  Because everybody was carrying briefcases.  So how would you carry them?  Because they were not backpacks.  No, no.

SPEAKER_00: 2:24:23-2:24:24
 In your hands, they told me.

SPEAKER_02: 2:24:24-2:24:29
 Yeah, you carried them in your hands. So told me, you could carry them in your hands.  Yeah, you carried them in your hands.  So he was one of the few ones that had a briefcase.

SPEAKER_00: 2:24:29-2:24:34
 Right then and there you knew.  Ahead of his time.  Right then and there you knew.

SPEAKER_02: 2:24:34-2:24:39
 There was this like desire or like, you know, there was a certain kind of family style, I guess.

SPEAKER_00: 2:24:39-2:24:50
 Yes, yes.  But yeah, well, that's, her father owned a bicycle shop downtown, that's why.  Well, maybe he sold them the bike.  Who knows?

SPEAKER_02: 2:24:50-2:24:58
 Who knows?  And definitely I think that the parents were, I think they were very eager to do everything,  every possible thing for the only child that they had.

SPEAKER_00: 2:24:58-2:25:01
 Oh, yes.  For example...  I can relate to that.

SPEAKER_02: 2:25:01-2:26:15
 Yeah, so they remember that once they went to his place, there was a little  like gathering, and the idea that Richard had was for them to go to their, to like three  or four of their classmates, to go to the place and sing together a song that they all  knew while Richard was playing the piano, because Richard wanted to record a disc. So  his parents had bought one of the first machines to do all  recording. You know, this was not even... I know, it's like... Yeah, it was pre, like  the disc they were familiar with. It was pre-vinyl. Pre-vinyl. Yeah, because I actually... He  made one of these recordings, not the one with the classmates, but when Bob Gilbo graduated  Yes, which was 19 two years before so 1945. Yeah, Richard  composed  So he wrote a song he composed a song wrote the lyrics  Played and recorded on a disc for Robert  Wow and Bob kept that  And she gave it he gave it to me oh for Robert, for Bob, as a gift. Wow. And Bob kept that disc for a long time. Isn't that something?  And he gave it to me.  Oh my God.  So the recording is very poor, but like, you can, so I took it to an expert that digitized

SPEAKER_00: 2:26:15-2:26:17
 it, cleaned it up.  Oh, that did, oh yes.

SPEAKER_02: 2:26:17-2:27:07
 So it's on two sides.  On one side you just hear him playing the melody without words.  And on the second side you hear him sing. Oh my gosh. It's really hard to understand the words so together with Bob we try to recognize  some of the words but you definitely hear the melody very well and this was like and so Bob  says yeah I do remember that at home he had a one of the first machines to record the parents got  for him. Oh dear. And there was this like so on the one hand there is this very engaged kid that is already, besides being a musician,  can play, compose and so on, but he can also record, so it's technology oriented.  And at the same time, parents are very supportive.  They're there to get whatever you want.  Yes.  You want that?  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to do that for you.  They're there for him. It's a sign that they're? Yeah, yeah. We're going to do that for you.  I know.  They're there for him.

SPEAKER_00: 2:27:07-2:27:55
 It's a sign that clearly...  Oh, yeah.  It's so wonderful.  No, it's wonderful.  Yeah, no, it's, you know, being an only child like that, it's, you know, sort of...  I'm not non-ad of something like that because he recorded my great-grandmother, not on her  side, the other, the Bermudji side.  And we have these records.  Yeah.  And I've got them.  And luckily I have a, I bought one of those little record,  you know the new, yeah.  I have not played them, but I have heard them in the past  when my dad was still here and he would say,  oh yeah, you gotta listen, she's speaking in Italian  and whatever, and it's just so funny.  And the records are the 78 size, I think.  78, is that what yours was?  Okay, it's gotta be the same equipment.  That's very cool.  Very cool. You should keep all that stuff. I am keeping them, I'm not getting rid of yes. Okay, it's got to be the same equipment. Yes, yes, yes. That's very neat.  Very cool.  You should keep all that stuff.  I am keeping them.  I'm not getting rid of them.  I just need to listen to them.  But people don't appreciate those things nowadays.  I don't understand.  Now everything is text this and text that.

SPEAKER_02: 2:27:55-2:28:18
 For me actually, one of the many things that I learned from this project is a very deep appreciation for the past and signs and remainders of the past.  Like going through archives, talking and collecting little pieces.  Sometimes you think, oh, what's the relevance of this?  Well, you don't know.

SPEAKER_01: 2:28:18-2:28:19
 You don't know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:28:19-2:28:57
 You're right.  Just for an example, Richard decided to keep the letter from Bob.  And that was, for me, it was like keep the letter from Bob and that was for me, I mean it was  like a fortuitous case because in the archive I see this letter dated 1953 and Richard,  thank God, Richard in this obsessiveness, whenever he would get a letter he wouldn't  just keep the letter but also the. Because the letter only says Bob.  But who is this Bob?  Yes.  But on the envelope, it has Robert Gilbo.  At that time he was in the Coastal Guard in Oregon.

SPEAKER_00: 2:28:57-2:28:58
 Yes, yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 2:28:58-2:29:38
 But then I thought, okay, hold on.  Robert Gilbo.  Okay, now the last name is uncommon.  So that's already helped.  Because if you have a very, you know, if your name is uncommon. So that's already helped because  Yeah, like for example there was a secretary at UCLA that I was very very close to Richard everybody lost track of her But what's her name? Mary West?  But in the case of Robert Gilbo I said look in the letter he says, oh I'm in Oregon now  but I hope that because I'm getting married with Barbara we can move back to the Bay.  I said well maybe, who knows, maybe he stayed in the Bay area.  Let me do a research.  Robert Gilbo, I put like California and here it is, Fremont.

SPEAKER_01: 2:29:38-2:29:39
 I know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:29:39-2:29:48
 I go and look at the real estate, oh they bought this house in the 60s, in the 61, 62.  I said well Robert  Gilbo and Barbara Gilbo.  Well there it is right there.

SPEAKER_00: 2:29:48-2:29:52
 That must be.  You had to do a lot of work.  I wrote this letter.  That's true.

SPEAKER_02: 2:29:52-2:30:33
 I wrote the letter and you know four days later I, you know I didn't realize that somebody  called my cell phone so there's a message, say hi Ivano, this is Bob, Robert Gilbo, I  receive your letter.  Yes, I'm the first.  Oh my gosh, that was like finding a gold mine.  So I called him right away and I was still at Stanford for my fellowship.  I was about to leave Stanford.  I said, well, we need to meet right away.  So we arranged a meeting.  I drove there and I found this wonderful, to begin with, but also all these memories  that he had in particular, the time in high school with him, the friendship later on.

SPEAKER_00: 2:30:33-2:30:35
 Because he would have been older.

SPEAKER_02: 2:30:35-2:31:29
 He's two years older, so he's turning 80 this year.  And so all the time, the concerts they went together, the things that they did together and the disc that he had.  And he showed me the, he also gave me as a gift, the only picture that I have so far  of Montague's mother because she went to the wedding.  So this wedding picture where she's there, you don't see Richard, but she's there with  her sister, Birdie, the one that we really know. And Barbara says, Oh, I remember Mrs. Montague very well,  because at that time, you know, you would send out invitation and people would come  to your wedding. You don't need to invite them. She was the only one that wrote me back  and said, I'm planning to come and I would like to bring my sister with me.  Emma, you know, can I?  Because people would bring family and so on.

SPEAKER_01: 2:31:29-2:31:32
 But she's the one that replied.  Yes.

SPEAKER_02: 2:31:32-2:32:05
 Etiquette.  And then, you know, I remember that they came and she had her own gift and Richard had his  own gift.  Oh, wow.  But they somehow, they found out about our silverware.  And so they got matching like so they got  a serving plate. Yes. Oh yes. And that was Richard's gift and it made a silver and she  got the butter. Oh the thing that you put the butter. Yes the butter with the special  knife silver of the same pattern which was also the pattern that they had. Oh wow. So  this was kind of touch.

SPEAKER_00: 2:32:05-2:32:15
 I know, but you see, people don't do that anymore.  That's really neat.  And I found, I was in there looking for pictures one day,  because that whole thing is full of pictures.

SPEAKER_02: 2:32:15-2:32:16
 Nice, good to be back.

SPEAKER_00: 2:32:16-2:33:18
 Yeah, but the family, you know.  And I found this thing in there, and I opened it up,  and it was a letter from my husband.  To her, and he never.  To me.  Yeah.  When we were going together.  Yes.  Going together.  And he didn't write, my dad never got,  he went to Balboa High School in San Francisco  and he never graduated.  He only got to go to school two years.  Junior.  No.  15, 16.  Freshman, sophomore.  He got out in 16  because he had to help his parents.  He had to help his dad with work.  Well, his dad was crippled that time.  He lost it.  So he had to go to work.  So he never graduated from high school.  And he did not go to college.  He's, you know, whatever.  But here, he wrote this letter, and I was like, wow.  And I found this letter, I'm gonna frame it.  Man of many words.  I mean, he was.  No, I'm surprised, because I didn't remember. You forgot you had it? Is it still in here? It's still in here. I'm taking it home, I to frame it. He's not a man of many words. I mean... No, I'm... Because I didn't remember it.  You forgot you had it?  Is it still in here?  It's still in here.  I'm taking it home.  I don't want to read it.  No, see that plastic?  See the bunch of plastic?  Oh, yes.  Thank you.  This is a good place.  No, no, no.  You can't do nothing with that.  You can't throw it away.

SPEAKER_02: 2:33:18-2:35:34
 I'm not throwing it away.  I'm totally upset with my mom because she made a decision, and I don't know why she  made the decision, but I think it was a few years ago  She went through all the letters that my dad wrote her. Oh, no  And I don't know why I mean I tried to talk to her especially now that I'm here more involved with this project and  Because you know, my dad is not a man of many words  We're talking about education, you know, my parents come from a very poor background southern Italy yes around the second world war going to school was not like  my dad went to three years of evening elementary school because he started working when he was six  year old six yeah there was a it was a family of eight boys oh my god and my dad was the second to  the last one oh my my goodness. So they would  all follow with the dad. They would all work. They had a, I think it was, they were those  people that would buy the right to cut the wood from a mountain. Oh, the rights. Yes.  So because you need to know, you cannot cut everything. You need to know what to cut and  then you collect that wood and you sell.  So you pay the owners of that part of the mountain  a certain fee and then whatever you sell,  you make profit out of it.  So that was the family enterprise.  And you had to help as much as,  and plus they had some animals,  especially in the summer,  you had to take care of the animals and so on.  So my dad went to a school for like three years  of evening, elementary evening school. And my mom went to five years of elementary school because  she was the first one of ten children and my mom and my grandma and my grandpa  were working all the time to keep like you know the land and so on. So we're taking care of the  children? My mom and her grandma. And they were all like one after the  other. So when my mom was 10, she already had like five, six brothers to take care of. She's  telling me like going to make the bread once a week and the bake. So all these stories. So the  fact that my dad, when he went to the military, so he was 19, yeah, he was 19, yeah, he went to  the military at 19 and my mom was 16.  So he made an effort to do something they never done and it's like writing.  I mean like, you know.

SPEAKER_00: 2:35:34-2:35:36
 Yes.  Because not having...

SPEAKER_02: 2:35:36-2:35:46
 And taking these pictures.  The pictures are still there.  She's very proud next to, you know, the gun.  Oh yeah, they are, yeah.  And going to the photographer and then you send the picture home and after you're like,  look at me, how you're looking at it.  Oh, I'm in the military.  Yes, I know. all the guns, and go to the photographer and then you send the picture home and after you're like, look at me,  how you're looking at it.

SPEAKER_01: 2:35:46-2:35:47
 I'm in the military.

SPEAKER_02: 2:35:47-2:35:53
 Yeah, especially my dad that I always known  as like completely uninterested in his look and his hair.  But at that time.

SPEAKER_00: 2:35:53-2:35:57
 Yeah, oh yeah.  I was that much proud to be where he was.  Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:35:57-2:36:14
 Oh.  And so I said, why'd you destroy those letters?  Well, you know, it was a long time ago.  It was kind of like, you know, private.  Oh, private.  I know, but probably my dad must have been some sort of like made up words, like they  heard from the movies, you know.  Yes, exactly.

SPEAKER_01: 2:36:14-2:36:15
 You know, I'm sorry that you don't have them.

SPEAKER_00: 2:36:15-2:36:18
 I know.  Now with what you're doing, it's a perfect time to save her back.  I know, I know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:36:18-2:36:30
 I think now she realizes she made a mistake, but I don't want to hit on her too hard because  the damage has been made, it's not worth it. I know, I know. But I totally know a mistake, but I don't want to hit on her too hard because the damage has been made.  It's not worth it.  But I totally know what you mean.  Like the value of this.

SPEAKER_00: 2:36:30-2:36:45
 I even found some of me writing to Nonny,  or she writing to me at 2464 Greenwich Street.  Yes, in San Francisco.  And there's a couple of letters in there from her to me.  So, no.

SPEAKER_02: 2:36:45-2:37:04
 So, Joy, one last question about your classmates,  if you remember.  So, within the classmates that you had  and those that you remember,  can you think about anybody else who was like Richard  in terms of like being nerdy, being studious,  being like kind of, you know, unusual?  No, he was it.

SPEAKER_00: 2:37:04-2:37:50
 Okay, he was the one. Yeah, as far as the class, I mean  there was, no, I mean not being really smart, no, there were some smart boys in  there, but not like Richard. And Richard looks, I mean he looked the part, you know  what I mean? He looked like he was quite smart, and he was different.  You could tell he was a different kid.  So you could feel it, like you could see it.  Yeah, you could see it from the way he dressed.  Nobody was mean to him or anything?  Not that I remember. I don't remember anybody being mean to him, no.  I remember him sitting, I don't know why, but he was sitting in the back of one of the classes,  almost at the last thing.  But, no, I don't remember what class it was.

SPEAKER_02: 2:37:50-2:37:54
 So, in this sense, he was kind of unique?

SPEAKER_00: 2:37:54-2:38:10
 Yes, yes, he was. You could tell by those pictures.  The rest of the boys, you notice how they dress?  They dress, you know, and he didn't play sports, that I know of. Yeah, no, you're right.  And he just dressed different.  He was, he dressed like maybe he thought.

SPEAKER_01: 2:38:10-2:38:12
 I always told my girls, dare to be different.  Dare to be different.

SPEAKER_00: 2:38:12-2:38:15
 Well, he was, he was, but he was also smart.

SPEAKER_02: 2:38:15-2:38:36
 I also wonder, and that's something  that we were never able to solve, is like,  so Richard went to high school very young.  He was, when he started in September 1943, just turned 13.  So I wonder at that age, how much of, in terms of clothing,  was something that depending on him, depending on the mother.

SPEAKER_00: 2:38:36-2:39:00
 Well, that could have been too, but not knowing, you know,  I don't remember ever knowing the mother.  I knew Alma's mother because we went to her house.  One time, us girls, I don't know why we went to her house.  But his mother probably had a very good, I mean, a very  sense of dress helping him.  I don't know whether he thought he should wear that,  or his mother thought he should look like that.

SPEAKER_02: 2:39:00-2:39:02
 That's actually a good point.

SPEAKER_00: 2:39:02-2:39:05
 Because it sounds like her, but from what you described...

SPEAKER_02: 2:39:05-2:39:17
 I agree, and I think that the connection between mother and son was such that  if his mother was telling him or was getting those things for him,  for him it was natural to say, that's what I'm going to be wearing.

SPEAKER_00: 2:39:17-2:39:27
 Yeah, yeah.  It's like, you know, mom does this.  I don't know whether he would be going shopping at that age or not,  but he just dressed  differently.

SPEAKER_02: 2:39:27-2:40:06
 And later on, like when he became a professor at UCLA, of course he was doing his own shopping,  but he always kept this kind of classical look.  I mean, the philosophy department at UCLA, I mean, it was not as relaxed as these days,  but still, like it's not that you have to wear a jacket and a tie all the time.  There were some people doing that, but in general, sometimes, especially the young professor,  he would wear a shirt, a shirt with long khaki pants, that would be fine.  With Richard, no.  Richard was always like classical pants, a jacket, often a tie, you know, like...

SPEAKER_00: 2:40:06-2:40:09
 But I think it's the way he was brought up.

SPEAKER_02: 2:40:09-2:40:10
 Exactly, that's what I think.

SPEAKER_00: 2:40:10-2:40:18
 And I don't know if his father dressed like that either, not knowing...  Or painted a Pacific belt, probably not.  Well, I don't know, but I'm just saying, maybe he did.

SPEAKER_02: 2:40:18-2:40:20
 Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any picture of his father.

SPEAKER_00: 2:40:20-2:40:21
 No pictures of him.

SPEAKER_02: 2:40:21-2:40:48
 No, nowhere.  Because, again, that's the problem when there's not a family that carries over your memory.  Once they died, everything got lost.  And so there is no picture of...  I found that picture of the mother just because I was lucky, because of the wedding.  And so, what is unclear to me is that...  I mean, on the, Barbara kept the wedding,  what's called the wedding register, the list,  the wedding list.

SPEAKER_00: 2:40:48-2:40:51
 Yes, I have that too.  Like people could sign.  Yes, I have that too.

SPEAKER_02: 2:40:51-2:40:59
 And so there, you see the name of like Lorraine Montague,  Edgar Montague, the father, and then Birdie.  And then Richard signed separately.

SPEAKER_01: 2:40:59-2:41:00
 Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:41:00-2:41:04
 So, but in that picture, that was a picture,  like it was not a pose, like the photographer

SPEAKER_00: 2:41:04-2:41:06
 was going around. Yeah, he was going around taking pictures like the photographer was going around, going around, taking pictures.

SPEAKER_02: 2:41:06-2:41:22
 He was going around, you see the bride in the room in the background, and then you see  Lorraine with Bertie and a little girl walking in front of you, and that's the photographer  took the picture.  So, it just happened.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, though, we went through all their pictures, there's no picture of Evermont

SPEAKER_00: 2:41:22-2:41:24
 in the outside.  Oh, so did he not go to?

SPEAKER_02: 2:41:24-2:41:53
 I think he did. His name  is on it. Oh, okay. Except it just happened, you know, they didn't have many pictures.  And then they had a movie. A friend made a little movie. It was their gift. Yeah. So  and they digitized so I was able to see it. And lucky because you see Richard for like  three seconds. It starts from the profile and then it goes  to someone. But definitely recognize him. But unfortunately you don't see the father.  So I was hoping, but I really don't have any idea what the father looks like.

SPEAKER_00: 2:41:53-2:41:57
 Even if you punch in Montague and his name, nothing comes up at all?

SPEAKER_02: 2:41:57-2:42:10
 No, I search, I spend hours and hours.  Yeah, because that would, you know.  I have a subscription to Ancestry.com, but the problem is that in those days, as  you know, taking pictures was not like these days, there were a thousand, thousand pictures.  It was for special occasions.

SPEAKER_00: 2:42:10-2:42:11
 Yes, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 2:42:11-2:42:16
 And probably there were pictures of him, those were the pictures kept at home.

SPEAKER_00: 2:42:16-2:42:22
 And who knows what happened to him.  Did you ever find the doctor that took advantage of the mom?

SPEAKER_02: 2:42:22-2:42:30
 Well probably he's not alive anymore.  I can only look at the... But what about all the stuff that was of the mom? Well, probably is not alive anymore. I can only look at the, well,  But what about all the stuff that was in the house?  In 71, which is 40.

SPEAKER_00: 2:42:30-2:42:40
 Oh yeah, you're right.  I was just thinking maybe somehow that stuff got,  Well, you know, the stuff that was in the house, maybe.  Maybe he cleaned it.  In Richard's house, but how the heck would you find that?

SPEAKER_02: 2:42:40-2:42:49
 Well, the stuff in the Richard house,  so, was taken by the parents because I know, I went through  the real estate documents, so the house was sold where Richard died.

SPEAKER_00: 2:42:49-2:42:53
 Oh, but what about the stuff that was in it?

SPEAKER_02: 2:42:53-2:42:58
 Probably the stuff that they cared about, the parents took it to their own place.

SPEAKER_00: 2:42:58-2:42:59
 Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_02: 2:42:59-2:43:08
 What I'm saying is when she passed.  Then when the parents, she passed away, probably the relatives, well, the doctor has already  taken the pieces of furniture and the things that he liked.

SPEAKER_00: 2:43:08-2:43:09
 Yeah, oh I'm sure, but he wouldn't take the picture.

SPEAKER_02: 2:43:09-2:44:01
 Then, you know, the picture didn't care.  So probably they went there and I don't know if, because remember, the person I talked  to is the husband of the daughter of the cousin.  So the daughter and the cousin are dead and, you dead. I don't know, maybe they went to Los Angeles  to help and they discovered that, well, first they discovered that they were expecting to get  lots of money and they lost nothing. So that doesn't make you particularly happy.  You know, when Aunt Lorraine has promised you and you go there and you know that she's doing  very well, and you say...  And nothing.  And nothing.  No, no, no.  It's terrible.  I mean, she had given them, but like nothing.  I mean, she had left some, I think, to like a few thousand dollars that had been put in  a separate account.

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:01-2:44:02
 Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:02-2:44:11
 But they knew that there was big money there, And you know, just the house on Mullan Drive,  the value of that house was like $100,000.

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:11-2:44:12
 At the time.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:12-2:44:18
 At the time.  Yeah, $100,000.  That's a lot for that money.  So where's that money?  Where's that money?

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:18-2:44:18
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:18-2:44:20
 Plus the apartment complex.

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:20-2:44:22
 Oh, yeah.  They owned the apartment complex.  That should be more.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:22-2:44:26
 Yeah, 10 apartments.  Yeah, 10. No, that doctor was a more! Yeah, ten apartments! Yeah, ten!

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:26-2:44:28
 That doctor was a thief!

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:28-2:44:30
 Yeah, yeah!

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:30-2:44:34
 What's his name?  We don't know his name at all!

SPEAKER_01: 2:44:34-2:44:36
 He probably knows it, he doesn't know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:36-2:44:40
 Well, I found the documents,  but I mean at this point...

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:40-2:44:46
 He's gone, it's not...  I'm just thinking somebody would have maybe taken the pictures or something.  And.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:46-2:44:48
 Probably those pictures, you're right.  I mean, they were in the house.

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:48-2:44:49
 House, you know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:49-2:44:52
 Then they stayed there until she died.  And then.

SPEAKER_00: 2:44:52-2:44:58
 And then who knows.  And then they cleaned out the house.  Yeah, that's a shame.  Too bad.  Too bad you can't find him, but oh well.  It's all good.

SPEAKER_02: 2:44:58-2:45:13
 I mean, I, that's unfortunately the limit of,  I know, I mean, at a certain point I had to accept  the limit of this project. When you are trying to reconstruct the life of somebody who left  and then his family disintegrated right away.

SPEAKER_01: 2:45:13-2:45:18
 Because families are a major source of information.

SPEAKER_02: 2:45:18-2:45:51
 Pictures, material, memories.  And when those are lost, there's no...  For example, that's why I'm also trying to pursue every possible venue to try to find  any possible path to try to find the one with Bob Gilboa.  Because I always like in this particularly lucky case, it just happened that they were  at a wedding and they took a picture and now I have a beautiful picture of Lorraine where you can totally see that.  Because at a certain point I even thought, well, why did they wait 15 years?

SPEAKER_01: 2:45:51-2:45:54
 Maybe they adopted him.

SPEAKER_02: 2:45:54-2:46:34
 Because the other thing that made me think a little bit, people told me, the people that  met Lorraine, they said, you know, she was not, I saw from the picture, she was not skinny,  she was not big, she was medium size and she  was like 5'7".  The dad, the people that saw him and remembered him was like, you know, he was not big, not  skinny, not fat, definitely tall, I would say 6 feet.  Now, a mother 5'7", the The father, six. And Richard, not.  And Richard, five, five, six.  Yeah.  So, genes can combine in a strange way.  We know that.  But I thought, well, maybe they adopted it.  But you don't know for sure.  I do know for sure.  Well, now you know.  Now I know for sure because, well, besides the picture, can you see the picture?

SPEAKER_00: 2:46:34-2:46:36
 Oh, picture.  You said how the kid looks like.

SPEAKER_02: 2:46:36-2:46:40
 But then, at that point, it's okay.  Now I'm going to find the birth certificate.  So I hunted for the birth certificate.  Oh, good Lord.

SPEAKER_00: 2:46:40-2:46:42
 You did, yes.  I found it.

SPEAKER_02: 2:46:42-2:46:46
 And from the birth certificate, I found the birth certificate.  And I found it.  And I found it. And I found it. And I's like, now I'm going to find the birth certificate.

SPEAKER_01: 2:46:46-2:46:48
 So I hunted for the birth certificate.

SPEAKER_02: 2:46:48-2:47:00
 I found it and from the birth certificate,  actually that's a question I have for you Jo.  So the birth certificate shows that  Lorraine Montague gave birth  in an hospital.  St. Joseph, the Catholic hospital.

SPEAKER_00: 2:47:00-2:47:02
 Oh yes, yeah, in Stockton.

SPEAKER_02: 2:47:02-2:47:15
 I want to ask you Jo, do you have a sense  of, at the time when you were born, well,  of course you were too little, but like talking to women and so on, was it common for a woman  to give birth in a hospital or the default would be at home and then only in exceptional  cases you would go?

SPEAKER_00: 2:47:15-2:47:29
 I was born at home.  Okay, so.  But then her mother had issues, you know, issues, she almost died, so then they took  her to the hospital, didn't they?  No, she never went to the hospital, did I know her?

SPEAKER_01: 2:47:29-2:47:30
 Oh, well you were a baby, you don't know.

SPEAKER_00: 2:47:30-2:48:33
 I would know, no, I almost died.  Because my mother had, what's that?  She always used to tell me on her leg,  she had to be cut and they had to clean her out,  run water through her.  Septus? No, it wasn't water through her. Sepsis?  No, it wasn't called sepsis.  The blood clot?  No, it wasn't a blood clot either.  And see, it went away.  I had it in my head, but now it went away.  But I was born at home.  And my-  Do you think your friends were born at home?  Because St. Joseph's-  No, I don't know where Alma and all, I don't know.  I never asked them, it never came up.  I know I was born at home.  St. Joseph's, I'm surprised it wasn't there at that time.  No, but see, Dr., what the heck was his name?  I just said his name, Lynch.  No, it wasn't, Lynch was when we were older.  Oh.  I can see his face because I remember seeing him,  but I don't remember his name right now.  Anyway, she was born at home,  and when she had this problem, she got a...  You're talking about you were born at home?  Me, when I was born at home.  She gave birth.  She gave birth.  They put me in, I guess, a bassinet and covered me up.

SPEAKER_02: 2:48:33-2:48:34
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 2:48:34-2:49:27
 And they were working on my mother,  and I guess they, you know,  I don't know if the doctor was there at the same time or not.  So there's a toxemia?  It's like toxemia, and they had to clean her out.  She got an infection, time or not. It's like toxemia. It's like toxemia. And they had to clean her out. She got an infection, something or other.  And so then my aunt, no, Sierra Zena,  which would be Uncle Joe Gaddy's mother,  was there also, because they lived across the street.  And she went to see where I was,  and they had covered me up up and I was turning blue.  So they forgot about me because of my mother.  And then, Tia Rosina is the one that saved me.  Bottom line is, she should have been born in a hospital.  But see, in those days, it was 1930, right?  And so I was born at home in that front bedroom there.

SPEAKER_02: 2:49:27-2:49:44
 So I don't know if it's because,  but Lorraine Montague was 36 when she gave birth.  I don't know if because she was concerned that she was old  or just she wanted the protection of an hospital.  But I know for sure that because the certificate  is signed by the doctor.

SPEAKER_00: 2:49:44-2:49:46
 Well, mine is too.

SPEAKER_02: 2:49:49-2:49:56
 Which ensures that, you know, like it was a medical procedure. The doctor was there.  It says that it was a normal birth.  It was not a cesarean.  So I know for sure that she gave birth to that kid.

SPEAKER_00: 2:49:56-2:50:11
 Yeah, right.  See, my birth certificate is signed by the doctor too.  But I don't know if it says if I was born at home or not.  I have the birth certificate, but I know I was born at home.

SPEAKER_02: 2:50:11-2:50:16
 Yeah, you should.  It probably is, because I assume that since  they were issued by the same city.

SPEAKER_00: 2:50:16-2:50:17
 Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:50:17-2:50:22
 He says, because you have to say the time and the place  where she was born in Scotia.

SPEAKER_00: 2:50:22-2:50:23
 Yeah, I'm gonna have to look it up.

SPEAKER_02: 2:50:23-2:50:27
 It's just the same Hospital, Stockton.  Yeah, no, I was not in the hospital.

SPEAKER_00: 2:50:27-2:50:32
 And I don't think she went,  I don't know if she went to the hospital after that or not.

SPEAKER_02: 2:50:32-2:50:58
 I don't know.  Because the sense that I got talking to people,  because I asked this question to several people,  and for most of them, they were born at home.  Some people told me, yeah, you're sure,  you could go to the hospital if you wanted.  It's not that there wouldn't be women giving birth to the hospital.  But home was more or less the default.  That if there were some complications, you could definitely go to the hospital.  If you were doing okay, well, and you wanted to be fancy or for some reason...

SPEAKER_01: 2:50:58-2:51:01
 You didn't want to pay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no.

SPEAKER_02: 2:51:01-2:51:08
 No, which is telling because clearly going to a hospital and she didn't choose  the public hospital.  She chose the Catholic hospital.

SPEAKER_00: 2:51:08-2:51:27
 Well, the public hospital would have been really far away.  The general hospital, no, no, Dameron was not.  Stockton General where my aunt used to work was the, and it was quite a ways away.  It was, did you come up Highway 5?  Well, no.  Is that where Samuel Keane General was?  Samuel Keane General.  I thought that's Manor.

SPEAKER_02: 2:51:27-2:51:29
 But was it already there?  No.

SPEAKER_00: 2:51:29-2:51:31
 In Lathrop.  Lathrop.

SPEAKER_02: 2:51:31-2:51:35
 French Camp.  But it was already there?  Oh, yeah.  I thought that the building was inside Stockton.

SPEAKER_00: 2:51:35-2:52:07
 No, no, the General Hospital was outside.  Already in the 30s, was already outside.  In the outskirts.  Yeah, evidently it was.  South of Stockton.  South in French Camp.  Yeah, very inconvenient.  Yeah, I know where it is. Inconvenient, yeah. Yeah. Stockholm. South in the French camp. Very convenient. Yeah.  I know where it is.  Inconvenient.  Yeah.  And because my aunt worked there.  My mother's sister worked at that hospital.  That's how come, you know.  I thought that was Damron Hospital.  No, no.  Damron is kitty corner from the school that I went to.  Damron was where, oh God, Danny Nunes' wife works at Damron.  Or she did. Now she's in Kaiser,  but she was working at Damar.

SPEAKER_02: 2:52:07-2:52:09
 But St. Joseph's was within Softholm.

SPEAKER_00: 2:52:09-2:52:23
 It was there, yeah.  Right, okay.  Maybe not as big as it is now,  but it was there.  I would think so, yeah, it's been there for a long time.  It probably would have cost more at the time to go there.  Well, I'm sure, and see, I don't know insurance  or anything in those days, you know,  what they had and what they didn't have.

SPEAKER_02: 2:52:23-2:52:24
 I think you would pay.

SPEAKER_00: 2:52:24-2:52:38
 You know, who knows, who knows, because, they didn't have. I think you were paid. Who knows?  Who knows?  Because all I know is that my mother-  I think you're right about being an older mother.  She wanted to make sure she went.  I don't know because I'm an older mother.  I had my second child at 36, so yeah, I know.

SPEAKER_02: 2:52:38-2:52:48
 But also those days, because these days it's not actually... It's pretty common, especially  you have a family, you want to build your career, like you have a family, you wanna build your career,  or you have other reason, and you wait.

SPEAKER_00: 2:52:48-2:52:51
 You don't get married early on.  You're right.

SPEAKER_02: 2:52:51-2:53:13
 So I have friends that had their first kid  when they were 38, 39.  But those days was, I think, more unusual.  So I don't know.  And imagine if they've been waiting years and years  to have this kid, and finally the kid arrives.  You don't want to risk anything.  That's true.  You want to make sure that everything goes fine.  And so she says, look, we have some money.  Let's use that money.  Let's go to the hospital.

SPEAKER_00: 2:53:13-2:53:19
 Well if he worked for Pacific Bell, I would have thought he would have had maybe insurance.

SPEAKER_02: 2:53:19-2:53:35
 But in those days, I don't know.  Good question.  And I was lucky enough to discover that Ed Barakat worked for...  So he graduated in 1947 and in 1948 he started working for Pacific Telephone and Telegram

SPEAKER_01: 2:53:35-2:53:36
 Company.

SPEAKER_02: 2:53:36-2:54:08
 Oh, really?  Yeah.  So he told me a little bit about the story.  He never met Edgar Montague at work because Edgar Montague retired in 1948 to go to Berkeley.  So when he went to Berkeley and retired, he had already worked for the company. You know,  in 1948, Edgar Montague was 58 and he started working for them when he was 20. So he had  already 38 of work. So he retired from there. But in Oakland, he started working on car dealer, like he

SPEAKER_01: 2:54:08-2:54:13
 had a car.  Selling cars.  Selling, selling.  Oh, God bless you, man.  Bless you.

SPEAKER_02: 2:54:13-2:54:24
 And so Ed told me that unions with benefits were introduced sometimes in the late 50s,  early 60s.

SPEAKER_00: 2:54:24-2:54:25
 Oh, okay. Okay. And then their life changed quite a bit because, early 60s. Oh, okay.

SPEAKER_02: 2:54:25-2:54:33
 And then their life changed quite a bit because, for example, they had more benefits if they  were required to move.  Sometimes they would just move from one place to another.

SPEAKER_00: 2:54:33-2:54:37
 They would move, pay for them to move.  They would pay for them to move, but before that they didn't.

SPEAKER_02: 2:54:37-2:54:44
 So I would be kind of surprised that in 1930 they would have any kind of benefit or that

SPEAKER_01: 2:54:44-2:54:45
 kind of thing. Well, that's true.

SPEAKER_02: 2:54:45-2:55:27
 I think it was, I think that the two of them, they were living at that time, they were living  in that duplex that his parents had bought, which means they were not paying rent.  And he had a good job, he was a solid job, he had already been in that company at that time  for like 20, sorry, no, 18, 19, 20,  so for 16, 17 years.  So, you know, and he was no longer doing the street job.  He was working in like his-  In an office, yeah.  So probably, you know, and they really wanted the scheme.  So you can imagine that everything possible that was done- They're gonna do, right, really wanted a scheme.  You can imagine that everything possible that was done.

SPEAKER_00: 2:55:27-2:55:28
 They're gonna do, right.

SPEAKER_02: 2:55:28-2:55:31
 And so, probably she chose to give birth to the offspring,

SPEAKER_00: 2:55:31-2:55:33
 which was good for me because at least I got the father

SPEAKER_02: 2:55:33-2:55:39
 to rectify it and direct it.  That's true.  And then with a picture, it compares.  Okay, there are things.

SPEAKER_00: 2:55:39-2:55:50
 I know that's a result.  That's a result for sure.  Right.  That makes sense.  Wow, I just. Yeah, so that's just result for sure. That makes sense. Wow. I just...  Yeah, so that's just a strange story.  I can't wait.  What is your time span now?

SPEAKER_02: 2:55:50-2:56:09
 So my plan is to finish a full draft of the book by the end of this year, December 2016.  Then for six months, the draft is going to circulate to a few people that volunteer to  read it, the reviewers and so on to get the feedback, to correct  and so on, and prepare the final version by the end of 2017.

SPEAKER_01: 2:56:09-2:56:12
 Okay.  All right.  I'm still here.

SPEAKER_02: 2:56:12-2:56:16
 You'll be here.  Oh, yeah.  No doubt.  No doubt.

SPEAKER_00: 2:56:16-2:56:21
 Are you still teaching as you're doing this?  Or are you like on a sabbatical?

SPEAKER_02: 2:56:21-2:56:30
 I wish I could be on sabbatical.  So I was on sabbatical the year I was a Stanford, 2014, 2015.  Now I'm back to service.  So it's a...

SPEAKER_00: 2:56:30-2:56:32
 When does school come back?  School come back...

SPEAKER_02: 2:56:32-2:56:34
 You see school September?  We have the quarter system.

SPEAKER_00: 2:56:34-2:56:35
 Quarter, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:56:35-2:56:37
 So we start September the 22nd.  Okay.

SPEAKER_01: 2:56:37-2:56:38
 Same as campus, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:56:38-2:56:44
 So that's why I'm trying to work over the summer as much as possible because this is  really my free time.  Once you start teaching, it's much harder.

SPEAKER_00: 2:56:44-2:56:45
 Oh, yeah.

SPEAKER_02: 2:56:45-2:56:54
 Oh, I know.  There are other commitments and it's not just teaching, it's advising.  And then once you become a more senior professor, they want you to be a member of a committee

SPEAKER_00: 2:56:54-2:56:56
 and participate in meetings.  Oh, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 2:56:56-2:57:04
 It's always overwhelming.  I just want to work on my book.  I just want to finish my book.  And then you arrive at the end of the day and you're so tired that you don't find the  energy.  So that's why.

SPEAKER_00: 2:57:04-2:57:10
 Did you... I don't know if, yes.  Oh, that's guests.  Angelo Stagnaro.

SPEAKER_02: 2:57:10-2:57:10
 Yes.

SPEAKER_00: 2:57:10-2:57:26
 Did you find him?  He worked at that St. Joseph's, you know.  He does, he does.  St. Joseph's Hospital?  Well, he's not a doctor.  He does, I remember him being there  when my mother was there.  He helps, you know, like the pink ladies.  Oh, he volunteers.

SPEAKER_02: 2:57:26-2:57:30
 He volunteers.  Unfortunately, yes, so.

SPEAKER_00: 2:57:30-2:57:32
 Oh, I just saw his.

SPEAKER_02: 2:57:32-2:57:33
 He's not doing very well.

SPEAKER_00: 2:57:33-2:57:34
 Oh no?

SPEAKER_02: 2:57:34-2:57:35
 Yeah, yeah, so.

SPEAKER_00: 2:57:35-2:57:37
 He's younger than me, I think.

SPEAKER_02: 2:57:37-2:57:38
 He's the class after you.

SPEAKER_00: 2:57:38-2:57:39
 After me, yes.

SPEAKER_02: 2:57:39-2:58:33
 So I talked to Barbara, Barbara Kalkani.  Wait a minute, let me look here. There's so many people, I don't know. Well, that one doesn't ring a bell. Because she's the 1948 class. So I talked to her because somebody told me that she had pictures because she and her  mother were taking pictures. So I called her and she said, well  Ivano I vaguely remember, I mean really vaguely remember Richard, but you may want to talk  to Angelo because he, you know, maybe as a boy he had more to do with him and so on.  She just said, you know, last time I talked to him he was not doing that great. His mind  is great but I think there were some problems. Oh, that's too bad.  So I called him. She gave me the phone number. I said, why don't you try to call him? I called  him, but he could barely talk.  Oh, poor guy.  Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 2:58:33-2:58:35
 I remember seeing him there.  And he was talking.

SPEAKER_02: 2:58:35-2:58:45
 Oh, poor guy. He must have had a stroke or something.  And he said, I cannot talk to you.  Oh, poor guy.  I'm so sorry.  That's too bad. I cannot talk to you, so I'm very sorry.

SPEAKER_00: 2:58:45-2:59:00
 That's too bad.  And then I see there's an honorable guest at my reunion.  Honorable Judge Jim Barakat.  Must be related to Ed.  His brother.  His brother? He died?  Oh, jeez.

SPEAKER_02: 2:59:00-2:59:03
 I think Ed is the only one left.  Wow.

SPEAKER_00: 2:59:03-2:59:06
 Ed is the only one left?  What happened to Selma and Elma, the twins?

SPEAKER_02: 2:59:06-2:59:08
 He didn't say anything.

SPEAKER_00: 2:59:08-2:59:16
 Oh, good Lord.  Twin sisters?  Yes, Selma and Elma.  They were older.

SPEAKER_02: 2:59:16-2:59:22
 Because at some point he told me.  Well, that's right. He's 80.  He says I'm the only one left.

SPEAKER_00: 2:59:22-2:59:24
 Oh my God.

SPEAKER_02: 2:59:24-2:59:27
 Because I saw those looking at the yearbooks.  That's how I learned how to do it.

SPEAKER_00: 2:59:27-2:59:28
 No, that's, you know, I'm looking at the back here.

SPEAKER_02: 2:59:28-2:59:31
 I'm starting to get familiar with the last name and then it's, oh.

SPEAKER_00: 2:59:32-2:59:35
 Linwood died too, see?  Linwood Cornelia, he was in our class.

SPEAKER_02: 2:59:35-2:59:36
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 2:59:37-2:59:52
 Margaret, oh, no wonder, Margaret Maxwell Santella, she passed away too.  Oh, you didn't read that?  Well, I did, but I put it away and then I haven't,  and then Andrew.  See, you gotta get these people watered.  Okay, there's Andrew Delucchi.  I wonder if he was what's-her-name's husband.

SPEAKER_02: 2:59:52-2:59:55
 He was her husband.  Because he passed away.  He passed away, yeah.

SPEAKER_00: 2:59:55-3:00:00
 Alma.  I wonder, well Andrew, that was Mary Phelan, whatever.  Yes, you're right.  Yes.

SPEAKER_02: 3:00:00-3:00:01
 She changed last name.

SPEAKER_00: 3:00:01-3:00:02
 She's got three names.

SPEAKER_02: 3:00:02-3:00:04
 Yes, plus her maiden name.

SPEAKER_00: 3:00:04-3:00:12
 Plus her maiden name. I only have one and I don't want any more now.  Can you turn that off? I have an off the record question.  Sure.
